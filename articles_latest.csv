 Anshu Jamsenpa an Everester from Bomdila, Arunachal Pradesh, the only Indian woman to have scaled the Mt. Everest thrice and the only mother in the world to have done so twice in 10 days. Whew!Dream. Dare. Win. You have to first dream, and then dare to fulfill that dream and finally you win. The mind is very powerful. You can achieve what your mind perceives. But it is very important to know your weaknesses and strengths. Positive attitude gives you the strength to fight against all odds.I am a mountaineer from Bomdilla, a small town in Arunachal Pradesh along the Indo-Chinese border. Have you heard of my hometown? There are just 25,000 people there and it is a beautiful place. I am 35 years old and a proud mother of two daughters aged 13 and 9.As a child I was always interested in adventure activity and was passionate about it. But the opportunity came by in 2009 when Wange my husband, organized National Himalayan Trekking Programme which had rock climbing as one of the events . One afternoon, I prepared lunch for some of the mountaineer friends and went over. It was a god sent opportunity for me! The group of rock climbers did a recce on the rock face and they were taking time to decide. Impulsively I went up to them and said I wanted to try. They were pleasantly surprised and happy to take me in. I finished rapping down the rock face successfully. I joined the last group of trekking. They said, â€œyou are courageousâ€ and that is how my journey as a mountaineer began. I learnt itâ€™s a huge subject. I took up a fifteen-day course after which I wanted to do a basic course. The instructors were impressed and told me that I could climb the Everest. I spoke to Wange about it and we decided that after completing the advanced course I would go for it.The decision to scale Everest was taking me a step closer to my goal of helping out people, as mountaineering had social and economic benefits to offer. Since my childhood I wanted to do something different. I guess that was a strong inspiration to try and go to the top.After the initial euphoria settled down, I realized that being a mountaineer has its own difficulties. Mountaineering is expensive and one of the most risky adventure sport. Arranging finances for my expedition was the biggest challenge.
 During my initial stage I faced a lotof discouragement. But later on after I had my achievements and mountaineering records to show, things changed. Apart from that, emotional, mental and physical hardships also had to be dealt with. I knew it is never going to be easy to be as a mother to even make an attempt but I also knew that if I attempt I wonâ€™t look back. I think itâ€™s about conviction and self â€“belief.In 2015 on the 7thof April the expedition for Mt.Everest was flagged off in Itanagar. With great enthusiasm and determination, I started my journey. Through my past experiences I have come to realize that no matter how well prepared you are, its helplessness that one faces when it comes to the forces of nature.
 On 25th of April the earthquake that shook Nepal, took its toll in the form of numerous avalanches on Mt. Everest. It is the worst thing that can happen during a mountain expedition. I was lucky to have survived the fury of nature but others werenâ€™t so lucky. Our camp side at Everest base camp was totally destroyed by the avalanche. Along with other mountaineers and sherpas, we cleared the debris, helped the injured and collected whatever was left of the expedition, with a sense of desolation. It was a sad situation at the base camp with many dead and injured mountaineers spread all over.This has not been the first time that an expedition has been called off and it is not an easy situation to deal with. You see your goal ahead, charged up with all the energy, and then it suddenly disappears. It is like dreaming a beautiful dream and just before you reach where you were headed, someone shakes you up. It is very upsetting but I am keeping myself motivated and hoping that my dream will be fulfilled someday soon.I would like to tell the youth of our country that they should be passionate about everything they do in life. Believe in yourself.This year I got associated with Reachout Foundation and I support the cause you are working for. I feel if you really want the country to develop then there cannot be any discrimination. I am always ready to do whatever I can to fight prejudice and discrimination. Yes, we can !-Our Stories.org.in"

The agency also quotes a local official as saying a blast was heard by villages in the region.NDTV also quoted chief secretary Ramesh Negi of having said that chopper like object sighted on Tuesday. But in reality nothing has been confirmed yet. The Faux Pas is a grim reminder of what the then Governor Gen (Retired) JJ Singh said to the very same channel about the then Chief Ministerâ€™s missing chopper having landed in Bhutan safely when Dorjee Khandu went missing.

Barua, who has ordered a â€œbanâ€ on two organisations representing the community, has denied a hand in the killings, and accused police of having â€œcreatedâ€ the July 14 incident at Bijuliban village. Police have, meanwhile, arrested one of the three Ulfa â€œboysâ€ who carried out the attack on Shahâ€™s home.Language data from the 2011 Census for Assam is not available, but calculations based on data from 2001, when the Hindi-speaking population was 5.9 per cent of the state, would suggest there are between 15 lakh and 18 lakh Hindi-speakers in Assam today. This significant number is the result of a flow of people from the Hindi belt to Assam for over five or six centuries. With the exception of the newer migrants who have arrived in, say, the last 40 or 50 years, the majority among the original Hindi-speakers are today as good as Assamese.Take for instance, the family of Biswanath Mahato of Krishnapur village, barely 2 km from where the Ulfa attacked Nandalal Shah. Sixty-five-year old Mahatoâ€™s father, Jai Krishna Mahato, came to Assam from Chhapra, Bihar, and settled down in Sadiya at the far eastern end of the state. This was in 1926 â€” the same year in which the great Bhupen Hazarika was born in Sadiya. Biswanath himself was born in Sadiya, went to an Assamese-medium school, and later moved to Krishnapur under a government scheme to rehabilitate families who had lost their land following the erosion of the Brahmaputraâ€™s banks after the great earthquake of 1950.Biswanathâ€™s four sons and daughter went to Assamese-medium schools, and so have all his grandchildren. The familyâ€™s links with Chhapra and Bihar disappeared long ago. The Mahato familyâ€™s case is not unusual. 15,000 families with roots in Bihar and UP live in Tinsukia, spread over 300 of the districtâ€™s 1,100 villages. Tinsukia is also home to about 4,000 Marwari families, many of them permanent residents of interior villages, living side by side with families that are ethnically Assamese â€” like the Ahoms, Morans and Mataks. There are 100 â€˜Bihariâ€™ families in Gohain Krishnapur, for instance, and 150 in Bamungaon. Ten such families live in Sonowalgaon, 20 in Missimikota, 40 in Bormura Miripathar, and five in Ahomgaon. Several villages in the district are home to people with Chinese roots. The indigenous communities had never thought of people like Biswanath Mahato or Nandalal Shah as â€œoutsidersâ€ until the Ulfa began targeting them in the early 1990s. â€œI had so many classmates from those families in Phillobari Middle School and Phillobari High School. Some of our teachers too were from this community, and many of us fondly remember R K Singh, our â€˜Hindi Sirâ€™. He would visit every student at home before exams to ask about their preparation,â€ says Sashikanta Saikia, a resident of Bijuliban and principal of DHSK College in Dibrugarh, one of the oldest and most reputed colleges of upper Assam. â€œMy grandfather Ram Bachan Singh came from Kachhua Chakuti, a village in Biharâ€™s Darbhanga district, around 1895, and settled in Doomdooma. My father Lalan Prasad Singh was born in Doomdooma, and became president of the All Assam Studentsâ€™ Union in 1972, a post that Prafulla Kumar Mahanta occupied six years later,â€ says Bikash Singh, a journalist with The Economic Times in Guwahati.Ram Bachan was chairman of Doomdooma Town Committee for 25 years. Lalan Prasad, who was arrested during the AASU movement for declaring Assamese as the sole medium of instruction in the state, also composed several patriotic songs and produced an Assamese film. Before his death in 1995, Lalan Prasad looked after Ananta Cinema in Doomdooma, which Ram Bachan built in the early 1960s. â€œMigration of people from Bihar, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Nepal to Assam is a very old story,â€ says Udayan Misra, a former Dibrugarh University professor and Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla. â€œThose from Bihar and UP, who are nowadays referred to as â€˜Bhojpurisâ€™, had started coming from around 1826, when Assam became part of British India. They have now become such a part of the society in Assam that you can no longer separate them from the other Assamese communities,â€ Misra said.So why does the Ulfa sometimes target the Hindi-speaking people?â€œThe Ulfa believes that an attack on a Hindi-speaking settler sends out signals to the central government. They know they will get a lot of media coverage, as well as reactions from the large number of MPs from the Hindi belt,â€ says Parshuram Dubey, president of the All Assam Bhojpuri Parishad. Assam Police chief Khagen Sarma agrees. â€œAlso,â€ he says, â€œHindi-speaking persons are vulnerable because they are all over, even in the remotest of villages.â€ Sunil Nath, who as Siddhartha Phukan was Ulfaâ€™s publicity secretary until his surrender in 1992, sees a local socio-economic angle in the groupâ€™s hostility.â€œIn Tinsukia, I think this is a local problem of economic domination among different communities that the present set of Ulfa militants often take advantage of. The Bihari or Marwari settler is more hardworking and enterprising. This makes others envious of him, and the present set of Ulfa leaders, who lack political wisdom and ideology, take advantage of this,â€ Nath says. Since its inception, Ulfa has killed at least 300 â€˜Hindi-speakingâ€™ people. Nearly 200 of them were killed between 2000 and 2007. Some of the original migrants have left Assam over the years. But the majority, like the families of Nandalal Shah or Biswanath Mahato or Lalan Prasad Singh have nowhere to go. They belong to Assam.-Indian Express"

Among the provisions proposed is to charge with murder an offender who accuses a person of being a witch and the causes of the victimâ€™s death.As community involvement is witnessed in witch hunting cases at times, the draft Bill has proposed to fine each member of the community between Rs 5,000 to Rs 30,000 each if proven of involvement.

NASA launched in January this year the &#8220;Soil Moisture Active Passive&#8221; (SMAP) mission that has already started beaming key science to map global soil moisture and detect whether soils are frozen or thawed.NASA&#8217;s soil moisture data will be of much help in planning field operations including irrigation, said R.M. Bhagat, chief scientist who is leading the climate research at the 104-year-old Tocklai Tea Research Institute (TRI) in Assam&#8217;s Jorhat district, nearly 300 km from Guwahati.&#8220;Tea gardens suffer intermittent drought-like situations. The scope of this data will expand eventually and will be of much help to farmers and planters in crop planning,&#8221; Bhagat said. &#8220;With the help of SMAP, soil moisture in the top five-cm of soil on the Earth&#8217;s surface will be measured from an orbiting observatory (or space vehicle) daily at around 10-km area resolution,&#8221; Bhagat said. NASA has initially included 50 institutions worldwide to get this data and TRA is one of them, he added.Tea production in Assam is currently facing many challenges including climate change, less labour availability plus increase in wages, and less availability of chemicals to control pests due to implementation of the &#8220;plant protection code&#8221;. &#8220;Due to climate extremes &#8212; too much or too less rainfall &#8212; tea is becoming more vulnerable to pest attacks. Conditions are becoming more conducive for the growth and proliferation of certain pests,&#8221; Bhagat told IANS.The plant protection code was implemented this year to regulate chemicals in tea cultivation and to make tea a safe and healthy drink. &#8220;The scope of the SMAP data will expand eventually and will be of much help to farmers and planters in crop planning,&#8221; Bhagat stressed. Assam annually produces over 600 million kg of tea in an area of over 300,000 hectares. This is part of the over 1,100 million kg of tea produced in India, of which over 200 million kg is exported, according to official data.The first tea plantations in Assam were started by the East India Company in the 1830s. Assam tea &#8211; scientific name Camellia sinensis assamica &#8212; produces rich, deep-amber liquor with a brisk, strong, distinctive malty taste. Soil moisture indirectly affects people&#8217;s lives as the topsoil is the one where food is grown. In the course of its observations, the SMAP will also determine if the ground is frozen or thawed in colder areas of the world.According to Bhagat, the TRI has also tied up with other global organisations to improve the quality of Assam tea. &#8220;We have tied up with Cranfield University of Britain to work on Soil Carbon stocks and climate resilience. Depleting soil carbon in soil results in deteriorating soil health. Thus, increasing soil carbon helps in nutrient build-up, good soil health and retention of both water and nutrients,&#8221; he explained.&#8220;This project will bring together researchers from Cranfield and Tocklai TRI to work jointly on this project for sustaining tea production in the face of climate change via studying Soil Carbon and ways and means to build this important component of soil,&#8221; Bhagat said. TRI is also collaborating with London-based Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), which will use its experiences in Kenya&#8217;s tea plantations in formulating strategies in Assam, with more emphasis on small tea growers.Research on all aspects of tea cultivation and processing is carried out at Tocklai, the oldest and largest research station of its kind in the world, whose advisory network covers 1,076 tea estates. The new era of tea research in India began with the establishment of the Scientific Department of Indian Tea Association (ITA) in 1900.

After completing his Class X exams from a madrassa at Rangiya, Raju had joined a madrassa at Azad Market area of New Delhi around seventeen years back.&#8220;According to information available with us, he had then joined the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). However, after SIMI was banned in 2001, Raju reportedly joined a Pakistan-based outfit, most likely the Lashkar-e-Taiba,&#8221; said a senior official at the Assam Police Special Branch.There was not much communication between Raju and his family after he left Assam. In 2000, Raju had asked his family to send him some money. His father, Md Halimuddin Moulana sent a money order of Rs 500, but it did not get delivered at the address Raju gave.On Saturday, some of Raju&#8217;s old acquaintances at Rangiya claimed to have spotted him with another suspect youth moving around in the town. After police was informed, a search operation has been launched to locate the duo. &#8220;We have some information. He (Raju) has been missing since ten/twelve years. He was recently spotted at Rangiya. He is believed to be associated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba. We are on alert and keeping a close watch,&#8221; Kamrup superintendent of police Indrani Baruah said.Police, who conducted a search at Raju&#8217;s Tamulpur residence last night, informed that he has not visited his home. Police is also trying to get hold of a latest photograph of the suspect. &#8220;There is an apprehension that such (Pakistan-based) outfits may try to create trouble in the State in the run-up to the Independence Day. And now with people claiming to have seen these suspects, we are on our toes,&#8221; a senior Assam Police official said, appealing to the people to stay alert.-Tsnl"

Now the design has been modified with requirement of 41 spansâ€¦ The total cost to construct the entire superstructure will now be around Rs 1,300 crore,â€ HCC Project In-Charge ( Bogibeel Bridge) Santosh Kumar Misra said.Hindustan Construction Company owns 51 per cent stake in the JV, where Germany-based DSD Brouckenbau has 20 per cent and VNR Infrastructure has 29 per cent holdings, building the girders or superstructure. The 42 sub-structures or the piers of the massive bridge are being constructed by Gammon India, which is also alleged to be carrying out the work at a slow pace.â€œThe earlier timeline given to us for opening the entire project to public was November 2015, but it has been delayed due to various factors. Now we will complete our work by December 2016 and the bridge will be opened for public by June 2017,â€ Misra said.The Northeast Frontier Railway project, which was first initiated during the tenure of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda in 1997, has missed several deadlines of completion since then. Misra said the starting of construction work got delayed by almost a year after receiving the contract as heavy rains affected setting up of the basic infrastructure to build the bridge at the site.â€œThe first span was launched in April 2014 and so far we have rolled out 10 units on the river. Another 10 spans are being prepared to launch by this month. We are now planning to deliver two spans every month,â€ he added. To expedite the work further, HCC is planning to add 150-200 more workers to its current strength of around 2,500 people at the southern bank of Brahmaputra, which has rication, assembly and launching facilities, Misra said. The 4.94 km Bogibeel rail-cum-road bridge will be the longest one in the country having the twin mode of transportation.Currently, the 5.6 km long Bandra-Worli sea link, also constructed by HCC, is the longest bridge but offering only road network in Mumbai. The total cost of Bogibeel project has escalated drastically over the years and is now likely to touch Rs 5,000 crore, which will take into account the main bridge, dykes on north and south banks, road network of 30 km, rail track of 74 km and six new railway stations among others.HCC claimed that a total of 70,000 MT of steel will be used for completing the superstructure, which will be equivalent to 10 Eiffel Towers. Being a fully-welded bridge, the total length of welding to be carried out is about 12,800 km, which is equivalent to circling around the moon 1.5 times.The Bogibeel rail-cum-road bridge will be double-decked having two railway tracks on lower level and a three-lane road on the upper deck flanked by footpaths on each side. It is located around 17 km downstream of Dibrugarh town and will connect the NH-37 on south bank with NH-52 on north side. Due to its location, the bridge will be of strategic importance to India as it will significantly enhance the ability to transport troops and supplies to the international border with China in Arunachal Pradesh.-PTI"

The minister added two other important facts. First, she indicated that an earlier such power project at Zangmu, other than the proposed three, is a run-of-the-river type. Secondly their effects and significance cannot be judged at the moment due to non-availability of data.The ministerâ€™s statement, instead of clearing the air of confusion and apprehension, is however likely to cause more doubts. There is an existing agreement between India and China which covers exchange of hydrological data between the two countries on the Brahmaputra. Has this agreement fallen into disuse? Secondly, the said projects being run-of-the-river type does not hold out any assurance because even these types of projects entail creation of storage dams.The aforementioned hydro power projects will be located at Dagu, Jiexu and Jiacha, all in the middle reaches of the Brahmaputra. Another one at a place called Zangmu, whose existence was long denied by China but ultimately conceded in 2010 after repeated Indian protestations, has already been partly commissioned. In spite of Uma Bhartiâ€™s apparent calm and nonchalance in the Lok Sabha, doubt persists in New Delhiâ€™s corridors of power. During the time of the previous UPA government it was decided that the ministries of defence, external affairs and the department of space would take up the matter jointly with China. Was it really done? An answer is necessary.Ominous warnings are close at hand. On March 1, 2012, the river Siang (the local name of the Brahmaputra in Arunachal Pradesh) had run completely dry at a place called Pasighat where it normally used to be very wide. Although the river picked up momentum later on, it has not yet attained its former virility.Moreover, all the four hydro projects will be situated very close to each other and this complicates the matter further as large amounts of water will be stored within a narrow geographical expanse leading to the possibility of depriving northeastern India of not only water but also the much-needed silt which makes the Assam plains fertile. There may also be floods in the region if China decides to arbitrarily release water from these dams during the monsoon.How many hydroelectric dams has China been constructing in Tibet? There is a great divergence of opinion on the matter. Some say the number adds up to more than 100. However Jana Jagriti, an Assam based NGO, thinks that 26 are coming up. According to its estimate, Assam will get 64 percent less water during the monsoon season and 85 percent less water during in the rest of the year due to Chinaâ€™s dam building activities.But the real cause of concern for India is the widespread report that China would construct a giant hydro power project at a place called Medog which is very near the Great Bend, a great U turn which the mighty Brahmaputra takes before entering India after a 2,000-metre fall. It is slated to generate 38-49 gigawatts of electricity, which is more than Indiaâ€™s installed hydro capacity of 33 gigawatts. If it materializes, the dam will be twice as big as the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze river. That China is serious about the Medog plant is borne out by the development and upgradation of the Bome-Medog highway, a kind of infrastructural development which generally precedes beginning of such projects. There are reports that China has constructed two huge water reservoirs at the Great Bend area with storage capacities of 42 million and 31 million cubic metres.All these projects are situated in an earthquake-prone area and very close to the geological fault line where the Indian Plate collides with the Eurasian Plate. According to many experts, the massive earthquake in 2008 breaching parts of the Three Gorges Dam was caused by the stupendous weight of water of the nearby Zipingpu Dam which was just half-a-kilometre from the geological fault line. If such a catastrophe occurs again, vast areas of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will go under water.-IANS"

 NET Bureau, Sanghamitra GoswamiA fan of Mythologist Devdutt Pattnaikâ€™s books, award winning doodler Santanu Hazarika draws his inspiration from the various aspects of Hindu Mythology. Leaving the lucrative career of engineering behind him, Santanu started telling stories through his doodles.From the 28 doodles exhibited around the world at the Red Bull Doodle Art Global Gallery 2014 in Cape Town, it was Santanu Hazarikaâ€™s winning doodle which left everyone awestruck with its intricate representation of the various aspects of Hindu Mythology.Talking about his feelings on being crowned as the winner of the prestigious event, Santanu shares, â€œThe time spend at Red Bull Doodle Art Global Gallery was surreal. To be surrounded by artists with the same vibration as yours in a breath taking place like Cape Town was almost like a dream. The Red Bull guys had done an amazing job with the instalments, where each entry was incorporated within a structure, portraying the countryâ€™s most iconic landmark. For instance, my entry was displayed within a replica of the Taj Mahal. It wasa memorable event of my life which inspired me not only to broaden my perspective towards life but also work harder.â€Leaving a much desired career of engineering behind him, Santanu has no regrets as he stands by the saying that one could be true to oneself only by following their dreams. â€œI believe that we should all do things that make us happy and doodling is what fills me with bliss. I am glad and thankful to God that He has blessed me with parents and friends who always stood by me in every walk of my life.â€ Currently working with Red Bull as a designer, Santanu has his own online apparel store called Dilate ink. Fascinated by works of Kerby Rosanes, Mattias Adolfsson, Salvador Dali and Richey Beckett, he believes that doodles are not any mindless scribbles taking shape in our notebooks as per common notions go. Itâ€™s more than just random scribbles and is a reflection of our subconscious mind. â€œIt is the result of our experiences which we were or are a part of! Initially, I doodled for fun. I would doodle anything, which would catch my fancy. I would do it anywhere whether it is in text books, pencil boxes or even on peopleâ€™s faces.  However, as time elapsed, the art slowly grew on me, soon developing into a habit and in the later years unknown to my consciousness, I became a doodler!â€quips in Santanu.Sharing about what doodling meant for him, Santanu whose favourite weapons are paper and ink, further adds, â€œIt was my escape from reality and a way to give expression to the innumerable thoughts whirling in my head. I felt awesome to be able to draw irrespective of the fact that they actually existed or not. It was like playing with my fragments of imagination.Nowadays, I mostly doodle to channelise my subconscious thoughts and purge my mind of all memories and prejudices. I do it in an attempt to attain pure blankness of the mind.â€ The interesting factor about his work is his inclination towards Hindu mythology and the Hindu art form. His doodles are beautiful representations of various aspects of Hindu mythology with hidden symbolisms everywhere. â€œBeing an Indian, Mythology is long imbibed in our thought process since our childhood. Mythology and culture has always been inseparable. As a child, I was mesmerised by the stories of Gods and Goddesses. Mythology in a way is the epitome of human imagination.One would be amazed to know how things like evolution, atomic structures etc are accurately depicted in forms of analogies in Hindu mythology. So what can be more inspiring than something which incorporates history, culture, imagination and realisation under one roof?â€ notes Santanu. So could doodling be the next big thing in India? â€œDoodling will very soon be a proper art form in India. Doodling over the past few years is growing really strong across the world and is slowly making an impact in India too. It is actually a form of visual language to be precise. It helps us to think, operate and even solve problems and India being a vast and fast developing country, doodling will soon be included in management and problem solving techniques. Apart from this it is a art form which can be implemented on any product , be it shoes , T-shirts or walls,â€ the doodler shared."

It all happened because of everyoneâ€™s love and support. Winning the desirable subtitles of Miss India Reliance Digital Miss Multimedia as well as We Chat Miss Popular, besides being in the Top 10 finalist of fbb Femina Miss India 2015, was like something out of a dream for me.NET: How would you like to describe yourself?RC : Thatâ€™s not an easy question for me as I have never described myself. The few close friends I have, says I am friendly outspoken but choosy when it comes to building relationships. They say I am focused, driven by firm determination, logical reasoning and confidence. To my family, I am a fearless angel, always helpful, disciplined and obedient. Though this may not summarize me as a person, but I agree to the observations made. Frankly speaking, I know I have not changed, but yes, I have become more matured and responsible now.NET: How did modelling happen? Was it a planned endeavour or a chance encounter?RC: I was born and brought up in the small town of Haflong in Assam. As a child, I always dreamt of becoming an angel, making sure I behaved like one. It earned me loads of hugs and kisses from the elders of my family! (laughs). My father, Baburam Chetri, a Government employee of the state and my mother, Bina Chetri, a homemaker, has always encouraged me to do whatever I love, standing beside me like two strong pillars.My parents told me that ever since I was a little girl, I would stand in front of the mirror and visualize myself as an angel adorned with a crown of stars. I guess that was when the modeling bug slowly developed within me, getting stronger with every passing year. Even though I was studying law in NEF Law College under Gauhati University, modelling was always there in my mind and I was waiting for an opportunity to grab. Howver it all started in mid November 2014 when I first attended the auditions and got selected for former Miss India and Bollywood actor Neha Dhupiaâ€™s show and the journey continued from there onwards. I cannot say the tryst with the glamour world was sudden, but I must say it was not planned. Things just happened at a quicker pace in a better way, opening up opportunities and new doors for me.NET: What are the important qualities one should possess apart from good looks in this industry?RC: I believe that dedication, intelligence and professionalism are the essential qualities. Dedication is required because it really is not easy to remain in the industry unless you put your heart and soul into what you do. As the industry is extremely competitive.

Lastly, without being professional you are nowhere in any industry!NET: Is Bollywood on the cards?RC: Bollywood is the dream of every artist in India and I am no exception.

Currently, I am associated with the Avas Foundation and Gorkha Youths of Guwahati (GYG) and helping
 the needy ones through organized channel.NET: Do you think being from Northeast, it has its share of disadvantages as believed by many?RC: When your dreams are big, the region you belong to or the language you speak can hardly become a barrier! This could be gauged from the number of talented reality show contestants and models that sprouted from our region such as Saurabi Devburma, Debojit Saha, Anamika Choudhury, Pradeep Gurung, Om Chetri, Rohit Sonar, Victoria Secrets famed model Monikongona Dutta, Model turned Bollywood actor Dipannita Sharma, Himakshi Agarwal, Sukalpa Das, Jantee Hazarika, Nangbia Chanda, Manik Paul to name a few.NET: What are your upcoming projects?RC: While I am talking to you, I just finished shooting a commercial for Byatikram Kindergarten School for Eastern India. I have also committed to Gorkha Youths of Guwahati (GYG) to shoot for Guwahati Goes Filil which is in lines of Resham Filili, a popular video in Nepali. I have already endorsed Topaz- a five star facility lounge, besides being the Goodwill Ambassador for Shailo Prabaho- a Bengali daily news paper published from my home town Haflong. My maiden music video album â€˜Tumi Murâ€™ directed by Deepak Dey and produced by Dream House Production is also releasing soon. Overall it appears to be a jam-packed year for me with various projects decorating my diary (smiles).NET: Your message to the aspiring models from the region?RC: To all the aspiring models I would like to say that if you can dream it you can definitely make it too. Work hard, be genuine and dream big. The doors of opportunities are always open. Modelling is not easy as it looks, but if you have the dedication and commitment you definitely can make it happen."

For that matter, lathicharge, tear gas, shells and rubber bullets should not be used arbitrarily and abruptly against the unarmed children, and ordering to use such dangerous and deadly means as minimum force without justifiable ground realities against the unarmed young children is unwarranted it was added.If required, the security forces should use other less injurious means such as repeated convincing warning through loud speaker, ensuring adequate barricades, water cannon may be an option as last resort, while encountering the young children. The proportionate force to their tender age and their probable strength should be taken into consideration before resorting any violent means. There should be always arrangements for ambulance and first aid along the side of such confrontation, it was further added.The underlying principle is â€“ our security forces and police should be rather children friendly and Protective Force rather than hostile force unleashing devastating impact to right to life and the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly. Excessive and disproportionate use of force on children and young students is unbecoming in a democratic country like India, a country which ratified the UN Convention on Rights of the Child and where Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 is in force.The Section 23 ((Punishment for cruelty to juvenile or child) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 states that â€ Whoever, having actual charge of, control over, a juvenile or the child, assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile or causes or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned, exposed or neglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile or the child unnecessary mental or physical suffering shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or fine, or with both.â€Further, The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules,2007 Rule No. 84 (11) also provides that â€“ â€œAny police officer found guilty, after due enquiry, of torturing a child, mentally or physically, shall be liable to be removed from service, besides being prosecuted for the offence.â€ The Commission also appealed to all the stake holders to treat Educational Institutions and Education as an Essential Service and exempt it from closure.-UNI"

It asked Manipur Government to apprise the Court of the steps taken after compensations were paid to kith and kin of deceased persons.&#8220;If you think it was a valid encounter, then why are you paying compensation ? Have you challenged any of the orders ?&#8221; the social justice bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and UU Lalit said. The bench said that the fact that the compensation has been paid to the next relatives of the deceased &#8220;amply indicate&#8221; that encounters were fake and the question would be &#8220;were they valid&#8221;. It gave the instance 2001 Parliament attack case and said &#8220;no Court awarded compensation to the relatives of the accused (terrorists).&#8221;However, senior advocate V Giri, appearing for the State Government, said that the payment of compensation on the directions of the Court is not an admission of an alleged offence. Meanwhile, the Court was told by the amicus curiae that the State and the Central Government and NHRC have provided a list of 62 killings that were sought to be passed-off as those of militants by security forces. The Court asked Manipur Government to file its reply to a petition by one Suresh Singh seeking repeal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act.Earlier, the court had asked the Centre, Manipur Government and NHRC to submit a comprehensive report on alleged fake encounter cases in the State, including 62 such cases where FIRs have not even been lodged. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for Extra Judicial Execution Victims&#8217; Families Association, had said &#8220;in all these 62 cases, not a single FIR has been lodged against any of the accused.&#8221;The bench had also asked Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh, representing the Centre, and the lawyers of NHRC and the State Government to provide requisite information to the amicus curiae who, in turn, will prepare a comprehensive chart of cases for the perusal of Court. The erstwhile UPA Government had earlier told the apex Court that findings of the Supreme Court-appointed panel&#8217;s report on extra-judicial killings in Manipur had been examined at the highest level.The Central Government had said that it was absolutely committed that no fake encounter should take place in Manipur and was equally aggrieved by the incidents. The committee, comprising former Supreme Court Judge Santosh Hegde, ex-CEC JM Lyngdoh and a senior police officer, probing six cases of alleged extra-judicial killings in Manipur, had come to the conclusion that these were not genuine encounters and the victims, including a 12-year-old boy, did not have any criminal record.In the light of the committee&#8217;s findings, the bench had asked the NHRC Chairperson to visit Manipur to examine how the Commission&#8217;s guidelines were being implemented there. The panel was set up to probe six cases of alleged extra-judicial killings in the North Eastern State where a magisterial inquiry had raised questions on the genuineness of the encounters."

The standpoint of Kuki Inpi (Kuki traditional Government) which has repeatedly been made known, is justice and ushering peace and tranquillity in the country, particularly in North Eastern States through non violent means.The Kuki people have never advocated violence, whether towards the Government or any other neighbouring communities except in defending themselves against armed organizations purportedly fighting for independence. The total disregard of memoranda submitted to six successive Prime Ministers of India that a pre-requisite for peaceful coexistence in the region is to first settle crimes committed against humanity in a proper law Court in the country may mislead one and all that violence is encouraged in this country, said Thangsei Haokip, Haosa (president), Kuki Inpi Manipur in the memo.It is rather perplexing that an entreaty towards justice, which had been what the traditional Kuki Government is doing, is thwarted continuously by the top brass of Indian Government. Rejecting Kuki Inpiâ€™s request is tantamount to denying the law Courts in the country to dispense with justice. A logical conclusion that might arise out of this lopsided attitude is not a pleasant thought. Ideally, law enforcement agencies have to tackle such matters of great concern before the public even raise their voice, added KIM.Therefore, any kind of settlement, agreement/accord prior to the settlement of the crimes committed by the NSCN (IM), which the very Indian Government labelled â€˜terroristâ€™ (cf. Does Violence get a Mandate, p. 33 published by Government of India) in a proper law Court of the country is unacceptable. KIM&#8217;s stand point has been made clear not only to Prime Ministers, but even to Presidents, Home Ministers, Ministers of States (Home), and also lately to the interlocutor, that NSCN (IM)â€™s crime must first be settled in a proper law Court, said the memorandum.What has been stated is a fact, and the authority ruling the Indian State cannot feign ignorance of this fact. The then Governor of Manipur VK Nair even visited Tamei Naga village on September 15, 1993 where 87 Kuki men were massacred on September 13, 1993 in broad daylight, that too in front of their wives and children, said KIM.Millions of Kuki people, citizens of the country deserve an explanation as to why they are denied their fundamental rights. The political appeasement on communal lines which seems to be the case in this latest accord signed will serve nothing but beget more violence, KIM said.-TSE"

Extension of relief measures or assistance to more than 200 people who were injured in police action in the course of the popular movement for enforcement of ILPS and punishment of the police officer who manhandled girl students during a protest agitation at new Secretariat complex were some other agenda of the meeting.JCILPS members demanded a copy of the Bill which was submitted to the State Government by the drafting committee a few days back.But the State Government refused to give a copy on the ground that the Bill has not been finalized yet and it is yet to elicit comments of legal experts on the draft Bill.Nonetheless, JCILPS opened the option of discussing the Bill together with the State Government and legal experts. The negotiation which took place between the two sides were more about the last ritual of Sapam Robinhood and organising a condolence service at the State level with mass participation.The State Government assured not to impose any restriction. The time and venue of the last ritual condolence service will be decided soon, Ratan said. He informed that the Government assured to take up action against the police officer who manhandled girl students at Secretariat complexThe meeting between Manipur Government and JCILPS was the first of its kind and JCILPS representatives asked the Government to give a concrete assurance that the new Bill would incorporate all the five points suggested by JCILPS earlier and the same will be passed before August 15.Pointing out many of the ILPS supporters and leaders are presently lodged in judicial custody, they demanded the State Government to release all of them without any condition within two days. In response, State Government assured to release maximum number of ILPS supporters and leaders today or the next day, he said The next round of meeting with the State Government has been fixed at 3 pm of August 12.However if the State Government fails to release the arrested ILPS protesters and leaders within the next two days and if the Government fails to give a concrete assurance to pass the Bill on or before August 15, JCILPS will not attend the next round of meeting, he said. The Government has so far assured to incorporate maximum points out of the five 5 points submitted by JCILPS in the new Bill, said Ratan adding this is certainly a positive development.The meeting was attended by 14 members of JCILPS including convenor Ibotombi Khuman, convenor-in-charge Kh Ratan, and women wing convenor Nganbi Devi. manipur Government was represented by Chief Minister O Ibobi, Home Minister Gaikhangam, all the Cabinet Ministers and drafting committee members Dr Ng Bijoy and RK Anand.-TSE"

 Journalist, author: 2014: The Election That Changed India.When the state collapses, when private enterprise is absent, the gun fills the vacuum.&#8220;Non-locals must not own businesses&#8221;: the Sunday headlines in one of Imphal&#8217;s prominent newspapers aren&#8217;t a pretty sight. Much like the Kashmir Valley, the Imphal Valley is also best described as &#8220;tortured beauty&#8221;: surrounded by verdant hills and a rich history, but wrestling with dark demons within. It&#8217;s a land which has produced great writers, artists, sportspersons, filmmakers, but one where an entire generation is being pushed into an abyss of hopelessness.The statistics my hosts &#8211; the All Manipur Working Journalists&#8217; Union &#8211; ply me with are shocking. Seventy per cent of the state&#8217;s youth are educated but unemployed: high literacy but no productive employment. In a state with a population of 28 lakh, as many as eight lakhs, or almost 30 per cent, have registered on the employment exchange. Is it any wonder then that &#8220;employment&#8221; options are often limited to getting any government job, or maybe even seeking benefits from joining the ranks of the insurgents? An army officer tells me that there are as many as 58 insurgent groups in the state, riven by factionalism, but united by the gun. When the state collapses, when private enterprise is absent, the gun fills the vacuum.My hosts have an even bigger grouse: the &#8220;national&#8221; media doesn&#8217;t cover Manipur. In the last month, several parts of Manipur have been flooded out. No headline. A little water-logging in Delhi or Mumbai and there are screaming breaking news flashes. No such luck for Manipur. In the last month, the city of Imphal has been virtually shut by blockades and curfews over the contentious inner line permit issue: simply put, Manipuris would like the influx of &#8220;outsiders&#8221; to be regulated with a permit system. A youth has been killed, every night there are candlelight marches to seek justice, schools have been closed for 40 days. No coverage on the &#8220;national&#8221; media. &#8220;When 18 Indian soldiers die in Chandel in an ambush, you will make it a big story for a week, when Manipuris die, you won&#8217;t touch the story. Don&#8217;t we count?&#8221; a journalist friend asks. It&#8217;s a narrative I have heard in the Kashmir Valley too. Guess conflict zones breed alienation. The &#8220;tyranny of distance&#8221; leaves parts of this country feeling isolated and unwanted. And pushed into a vicious cycle of permanent victimhood.I try and ease the pain by pointing out how a Mary Kom is now a superstar, how Manipur has been the number one state in the national games, how it&#8217;s footballers have become crorepatis at the soccer league auctions, how the service sector like airlines and hospitality offers new opportunities for young English speaking Manipuris. &#8220;Yes, yes, but there is more to us than just sports and Mary Kom!&#8221; is the refrain.At a programme on All India Radio, Manipur, I offer a solution: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we push for an exchange programme by which one journalist from a national channel/newspaper comes to Imphal or any Northeast state capital on a one year assignment and vice-versa?&#8221; A smile breaks out on the face of the pretty and talented radio jockey interviewing me. &#8220;Will you give me a job?&#8221; she asks hopefully. I nod my head non-commitally: &#8220;I will try!&#8221;Post-script: A few years ago, after a nearly 100-day-long blockade over the contentious Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), the price of a gas cylinder shot up to nearly Rs 3,000 in the black market in Imphal. That is when the blockade made it to the national headlines for the first time. &#8220;Do you want the price to go up again for our agitation to echo in Delhi?&#8221; one young man asks me angrily. I have no answer. Like many others, I am guilty as charged: &#8220;we&#8221; the &#8220;national&#8221; media have betrayed Manipur and the Northeast.-DailyO.in"

 NET Bureau, Dhiraj Kumar SarmaOn June 4, Indian army suffered one of the biggest casualties in an ambush led by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) at Moltung in Chandel district of Manipur. After the massacre, insurgency of Northeast once again grabbed the limelight. Northeast Today brings to you the past and present state of some major outfits as well as analysis on various aspects of NE insurgency.Separatist movements have affected at least four Northeastern states â€“ Assam, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland in the past. And the fact that there are still over 50 active insurgent groups across the Northeast is a grim reminder of the ground reality. The problem escalated when some Myanmarbased NE militant outfits formed a joint forum called United National Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFWSEA), which will soon form a Northeast â€œgovernmentin- exileâ€.In 1966, B George Verghese, the veteran journalist and intellectual, counted six active insurgencies in the Northeast: Naga in Nagaland, Manipur and adjacent areas; Meitei in the Imphal Valley of Manipur; Assamese and Bodo in Assam; Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council in Khasi Hills of Meghalaya; and the indigenous peopleâ€™s revolt of Tripura. Sundry other insurgent groups or splinter organisations, he said, are at large while others have surrendered or became dormant.NET: You have met both Khaplang and Paresh Baruah in person. What according to you are their strengths?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : Their strength is the terrain and also the unity that they have achieved among themselves. The unity has always been there, but now, four groups have come together under a joint forum called UNLFW and some Manipuri groups have also offered their moral support. The six Manipuri groups, who have camps in the region, formed an alliance called Coordination Committee (CorCom). Although they have not signed the declaration so far that was issued sometime back, they have offered moral support to UNLFW. As per the latest information available, at least three among the Manipuri groups agreed to take part in joint operations, which was apparent in the recent attack in which Manipuri groups KYKL and a KCP faction were involved. Their strength is also on account of the fact that there are arteries connecting the Hukawng valley or the region directly to China which ensures an unhindered and uninterrupted flow of sophisticated weapons and ammunitions. Another advantage is that Khaplang has a cosy relationship with the Myanmarese Army. The NSCN-K had signed a ceasefire agreement with the Myanmarese Army on April 9, 2012. Both sides have agreed to accept each other without any pre-conditions. Myanmarese Army in all likelihood will not disturb Khaplang or accept New Delhiâ€™s request to eliminate them.NET: With reports of â€˜government-in-exileâ€™ looming large in Myanmar, whatâ€™s your assessment of the current situation?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : The entire situation is in Khaplangâ€™s favour. As a result of the twin crossborder strikes Indian government seems to have played into the hands of Khaplang. Now Khaplang has emerged even stronger. Myanmar government is very upset over Indiaâ€™s cross-border strikes. Now there is no chance of Myanmar government listening to Indiaâ€™s demand that militant camps be removed from formerâ€™s territory. Khaplang will emerge stronger from this episode.NET: Insurgency and Northeast have become synonymous over the years. Why is it so?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : No region in the world has given birth to so many insurgent outfits as the Northeast. Not even Africa, Latin America and nor Myanmar. The factors that give rise to insurgent groups or insurgency is very much existent in the Northeast. The government has failed to tackle them. For the government, the Northeast is not that important, still a colony for the Indian government. Resources have to be extracted; armed struggles have to be suppressed with an iron hand. The Indian government has not yet understood the reasons what have given rise to insurgency nor is there any sincere effort to tackle the situation head on. Secondly, the Army with extraordinary power will not put an end to the problem.NET: So, where is the solution?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : As you know, currently there more than 50 insurgent groups in the Northeast. All the insurgent groups can be divided into five categories. Many people donâ€™t know that only about nine groups are demanding independence from India. Majority of the groups are demanding autonomy. The third category of the groups could be those without any ideology like that of GNLA of Garo Hills, who will do anything for money. The fourth group is sympathisers of the CPI (Maoist). There are reports that Maoists have been coming from Central India and started working in some pockets of the Northeast. But there is no concrete evidence of the reports. But one cannot lose sight of the fact that Maoists adopt a very long term plan. They work on a long-term perspective. Itâ€™s difficult to say at the moment if Maoist movement will actually grow or will fizzle out. The fifth
 group has grown with the influence of Jehadi groups and the Islamist groups of the states. This has been evident in the recent bomb blast in West Bengal and some sympathisers have been apprehended in Assam and in West Bengal. And I have reasons to believe that this network is spreading so this could be the most dangerous trend in insurgency in the Northeast, especially in Assam, in the years to come. The government better be on the lookout and persuasive on the whole scenario.(Rajeev Bhattacharyya is a senior journalist in Guwahati and author of Rendezvous with Rebels: Journey to Meet Indiaâ€™s Most Wanted Men. In 2011-12, he had spent four months at a rebel base in Myanmar where he interviewed ULFA chief of staff Paresh Baruah and NSCN-K chairman S S Khaplang besides interacting with top functionaries from other outfits that are now part of the new alliance called United National Liberation Front of Western South East Asia)Assessing Assam:Started in 1979, insurgency in Assam was at its height in the late 1980s. While the aim of the extremists has been independent Assam, the insurgency has roots in the history of Assamese sub-nationalism. The initial phase of militancy followed the changing fortunes of the Assamâ€™s agitation movement. In the writings of the Assamese author Parag Kumar Das, one finds the traditional economic grievances coming together with the theme of Assamese nationalism. Similarly, significant political movement for a separate Bodoland in Assam began in the year 1987. The campaign was launched by the All Bodo Studentsâ€™ Union (ABSU) under the leadership of Upen Bramha, who coined the term â€œDivide Assam Fifty Fiftyâ€.â€œThe perception of insurgency in Assam has been different in various generations. At this moment with a visible reduction in number of incidents and also factionalism, insurgency is more of an ideological threat than a physical one, it being nearly cleaned out by the army, government or globalization,â€ says Nayanjyoti Medhi, a Guwahati-based engineer, adding, â€œThis though is recent past, but the ghost that looms still prevents free flowing investments and scope for entrepreneurship, not because of fear but rather apprehensions. The world view of insurgency in Assam has to be changed for it to be rectified. Meanwhile, the present generation awaits for a revolution of peace.â€United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)ULFA was founded on April 7, 1979 at Rang Ghar, a symbolically significant venue of the Ahom kings, in Sivasagar district of Assam by some youths including Bhimakanta Buragohain, Arabinda Rajkhowa, Anup Chetia, Pradip Gogoi, Bhadreshwar Gohain and Paresh Baruah. The goal of the organisation is to restore Assamâ€™s â€œlost independenceâ€. Soon after it finished recruitment in 1984, it began to seek out training and arms procurement from other groups such as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). For one-and-a half decade, they almost run a parallel government in the state. However, on February 5, 2011, ULFA vice-chairman Pradip Gogoi along with foreign secretary Sashadhar Choudhury and central publicity secretary Mithinga Daimary announced that the outfitâ€™s general council had endorsed the resolution of the central executive council to sit for talks with the Central government without any precondition. But the commander-in chief Paresh Baruah-led group described â€œunconstitutionalâ€ the general council decision, thus negating the resolution. The formal split however took place in August 2012 when Paresh Baruah expelled Arabinda Rajkhowa and appointed Abhijit Barman as the outfitâ€™s chairman. The anti-talk faction of ULFA named them as ULFA (I) since April 5, 2013. They have around 300 active cadres, including those with the Myanmar camp. Of late, ULFA is facing financial crisis and it mainly dependent on NCSN (K) in Myanmar. Jibon Morang, whoâ€™s based in Taga region, has been shouldering the responsibility of financial revival. Currently, ULFAâ€™s eastern command is headed by Michel Deka Phukan and Dristi Rajkhowa is in the charge of its westerner command. And recently, Rajkhowa has built up a strong link with the Garo outfit GNLA.National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB)On November 25, 1994, the Rajan Daimari-led Bodo Security Force (BSF) rechristened itself as the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB). The main objective of the outfit is to liberate Bodoland from the â€œIndian expansionism and occupationâ€. During the 1990s, NDFB established 12 camps on the Bhutan-Assam border. After suffering major reverses during Royal
 Bhutan Armyâ€™s Operation All Clear, NDFB signed a ceasefire with the Indian authorities in May 2005.This was followed by a split into NDFB (P) â€“ the faction supported peace negotiations with the government â€“ and NDFB (R), which opposed surrender. In 2012, NDFB(R) split further, leading to the formation of NDFB(S) led by a non- Bodo, IK Songbijit. Prior to the military operations in Bhutan in December 2003, the strength of the NDFB was estimated to be around 3,500. Over the years the strength of the organization has substantially been reduced. Now it has around 500 cadres. Currently, with B Sargo Guera as president, Ferenga as secretary, Bidai and Batha as vice-presidents, the NDFB (S) has been recruiting new cadres to revive the outfit.Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO)Kuki Liberation Organisation was created by ULFA and it came into existence on December 28, 1995. The objective of the KLO is to carve out a separate Kamtapur state comprising six districts â€“â€“ Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, North and South Dinajpur and Malda â€“â€“ of West Bengal and four contiguous districts of Assam â€“â€“ Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon, Dhubri and
 Goalpara.Many secret operations along the Indo-Bhutan border have reduced the strength of the organisation. But still, KLO has over 100 active cadres. Although Jibon Singha of West Bengal is its chairman, currently the military wing has been taken care of by Kailash Koch. Recently, KLO, ULFA and the NDFB have formed an umbrella organisation to coordinate their activities.Nagaland and ManipurIn contemporary times, Nagaland and Manipur have been regarded as the breeding grounds for militants. Manipur alone has over 30 insurgent groups, a rare case for a small state. Manipur became a part of Indian on October 15, 1949. Its incorporation into the Indian state soon led to the formation of a number of insurgent organisations. Similarly, the demand for greater â€˜Nagalimâ€™ gave rise to a number of militant outfits in Nagaland. â€œJoining some militant organizations has become a fashion in our state and a wa of earning easy money,â€ says a student from Dimapur on condition of anonymity.National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN)
 The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) was formed on January 31, 1980 by Isak Chisi Swu, Thuingaleng Muivah and SS Khaplang opposing the â€˜Shillong Accordâ€™ signed by the then NNC (Naga National Council) with the Indian government.
 Later, differences surfaced within the outfit over the issue of commencing a dialogue process with the Indian Government and on April 30, 1988, the NSCN split into two factions, namely the NSCN-K led by SS Khaplang, and the NSCN-IM, led by Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah.NSCN (IM)
 Both general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah and chairman Isak Chisi Swu of NSCN-IM are now based in Thailand. The outfit has also established a government-in-exile called the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Nagaland (GPRN) which interacts with formal and non-formal world bodies. It has an estimated 3,500 strong cadre base. It is supported by a section of Aos, Semas, Zeilangs, Anals, Maos and Manipur-based Tangkhul Nagas. The group is in ceasefire with Indian Government since 1997.NSCN (K)
 Khaplang, popularly known as Baba, is perhaps the most respected militant leader of the Northeast. NSCN-K has cadre strength of approximately 3,500 with a following among the Konyaks of both India and Myanmar, the Pangmeis of Myanmar, the Aos of Mokokchung district, the Phoms and Yimchungers of Tuensang district, the Angamis, the Semas and the Lothas. The NSCN-K too runs a government-in-exile called the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Nagaland, NSCN-K.United National Liberation Front (UNLF): This group is the oldest militant group of Manipur and Rajkumar Meghen alias Sana Yaima is its current chairman. He was arrested in Bangladesh in 2010. Undeterred, the Manipur Peopleâ€™s Army, the armed wing of the UNLF, recently celebrated its 28th anniversary with pride. And Kh Pambei has emerged as a new popular leader. The outfit operates in the Jiribam valley and Cachar district of Assam.Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA):It was established under the leadership of N Bisheswar Singh on September 25, 1978. The PLA aims to organise a revolutionary front covering the entire Northeast and unite all ethnic groups to liberate Manipur. Revolutionary Peopleâ€™s Front (RPF) is its armed wing and Irengbam Chaoren is the president of the RPF. The group has a sound base in Manipurâ€™s Senapati district and almost 200 cadres undergoing guerilla training under Robin Lowang.Kuki National Front (KNF):Formed in 1988, KNF has a goal of sovereignty or independence from India. The group was formed in order to stand against NSCNâ€“IM hegemony in the Kuki-inhabited hill districts of Manipur. The group split into two factions in 1995 -presidential faction and military council, the former again splitting into two groups further.Meghalaya:Insurgency in Meghalaya is currently confined to Garo Hills region, although the hotbed was Khasi Hills till two decades ago. Militancy in Khasi Hills mostly triggered by the Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) was almost wiped out by iron hands.The outfitâ€™s existence is now just limited to calling occasional bandhs and issuing press statements whenever there is an issue confronting the Khasi community. On the other hand, Garo Hills, which comprises half of the stateâ€™s population, has become one of the most volatile regions of the Northeast. There are around a dozen â€˜militantâ€™ outfits that are born at the drop of a hat. There have been numerous cases of kidnappings, murder, and missing cases besides ambushes on security team claiming many lives in the past few years. The truce agreements and mass surrenders by some of the outfits have not been able to bring the desired results so far.There are also serious allegations of politico-militant nexus not sparing even the chief minister Mukul Sangma. One of his cabinet colleagues, Deborah Ch Marak, was even charge-sheeted by police for using militants during her election campaign in 2013. As the smoke appears to be not without a fire, cleansing of bad elements in politics will only bring about a solution to the insurgency in Garo Hills.Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA):Formed in 2009, the GNLA has been involved in killing, abduction, extortion, bomb blasts and attacks on security forces. It is fighting for a sovereign Garoland in the western areas of Meghalaya. The outfit was formed by a former deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Meghalaya, Pakchara R Sangma alias Champion R Sangma, after deserting the police force. He is the chairman of the outfit and Sohan D Shira, former Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC) area commander for East Garo Hills, is the commander-in-chief of the outfit. The cadre base of the outfit is mainly formed by deserters from ANVC, Liberation of Achik Elite Force (LAEF) and National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB).Interview: Kiren Rijiju, Minister of State for Home AffairsNET: What is the root cause of Northeast region suffering from insurgency continuously?Kiren Rijiju: Itâ€™s a long history. Some of the insurgencies go beyond our initial days of Independence movement and there are historical reasons. The hill belt comprising northern Myanmar regions â€“ Kachin, Sagaing and Chin province â€“ and the contiguous Indian states â€“ Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram â€“ has been problematic for a long time. They were not initially satisfied with the
 boundary demarcations and all these things. So when we came to power, we have this legacy before us. There are various reasons â€“ ethnic issues, sub-nationalist movements, struggles for identity, struggles for autonomy, and struggles for separate identity â€“ breeding insurgencies. But the reality is these movements are not going to succeed because they canâ€™t get independence. The fact is that we are part of this country and we are citizens of this country and whatever we want, we have to fight within the framework  of the Constitution of India. If we go beyond that, then it spoils the whole atmosphere and it brings miseries to the common people. Suppose if I take up arms, I may dent the interest of the government of India but the greatest trouble I bring
 is to the people of the area, my own people. Because of my acts, my people have to suffer. We have to realise that we should not strive for something which is not achievable. If you want to get some political rights, then fight politically. Today, Iâ€™m fighting for Northeast. Iâ€™m fighting for the rights of my people but I am doing it in a democratic way. Taking up arms is no solution to any problem. So, this is something we must avoid.NET: If the solution lies in the development of the region?Kiren Rijiju: The solution is peace. If there is peace, there will be development. If there is violence, then there will be no development.NET: How has your government planned to bring in peace in the insurgency-ravaged region?Kiren Rijiju: To achieve that we are committed to securing peace and we are already doing the developmental projects.NET: Will your government at the Centre sideline Manipur government after the recent ambush in the state?Kiren Rijiju: No, nobody will be sidelined. I have made my view very clear that when we take up some security measures in the
 Northeastern region or anywhere else, the state government will be taken into confidence and all the security measures are always taken jointly by the Central security forces and the state police. Without the involvement of state government, you can have limited success but you cannot have complete success. And law and order is a state subject, so the state has to own the responsibility of securing peace. So thereâ€™s no question of bypassing the state government except if there are some specific operations.NET: Do you have any specific policy to curb insurgency in the Northeast?Kiren Rijiju: We are going to be very strict and those who are not coming to the line, security forces will be very tough with them but at the same time, from my side, Iâ€™d like to appeal to all the people who have taken up the arms route to come back, join the mainstream, and then we all will fight together for development. Let us fight for development. We must join hands together.
 So the doors are open for those who want to shun violence and those who continue to fight against the state, they will face problems because the government is very determined to secure peace, and while securing peace. Strong action is always necessary. Itâ€™s necessary to do away with all the bad elements. That is why I want to avoid this kind of unwanted, undesirable military operations and where local citizens face problems. So best is that there should not be any violence and all the civil societies of the Northeast must appeal to the underground groups to not take up arms and create problem for the local people.Rajarshi Kalita Asst Prof, Department of English
 Shyamlal College, Delhi University:Rather than asking why insurgency has not tapered out, we need to ask if the reasons that created insurgency have been addressed at the first place. Has the much reviled administrative system, notorious for its babudom, corruption and tardiness been tidied up? Have there been efforts to set up industrialization and development of farmers? What does the youth in Northeast, the ones who have not moved out of their states, have to fall back upon, other than in the cities and the bigger towns?Insurgency is not just a mode of protest for many deserving, frustrated young men and women. It has also turned into a sort of survival tactic, albeit fraught with jeopardy. Easy money, at the show of a weapon, lures the youth already bombarded with cultural images of successful people. The culture of hard work, entrepreneurship, inculcating the value of hard-earned money and setting up an environment for these qualities ought to do wonders. The administration also ought to be sensitive to the peopleâ€™s needs and try to erase draconian laws and acts which have done nothing to solve the intrinsically political problems of the region.In Retrospect:The issue of insurgency refuses to die down in the Northeast and it keeps on surfacing in different formats. Whatever had happened on June 4 in Manipur is highly condemnable as nothing can justify killings. But, there are very strange things happening along the Myanmar border in the name of avenge killings and even the Manipur government is clueless about the â€˜combing operations.â€™ There is no clarity on the twin strikes as claimed by the Central government and it has boomeranged India. Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyawardhan Singh Rathore comments that the â€˜cross borderâ€™ operation was a warning to others harbouring â€˜terrorist intentionsâ€™ towards India and reminding Pakistan that â€˜56 inch rocksâ€™ also have turned into poor diplomatic approach in international relations.All this chest-thumping and back-slapping resulted in Myanmar retorting angrily that Indian troops did not enter Myanmar territory and that Myanmar would not harbour any terror camps on its soil. Ajit Doval, the national security adviser, who immediately visited Myanmar for damage control, was not wellreceived. To curb insurgency in the Northeast region, all that it needs is a sincere effort. Creation of employment avenues and effective policies for the youths of the region can be a readymade answer. Instead of applying an iron hand, the problem should be addressed in a holistic manner."

 NET Bureau, Arshad ShahFollowing the killing of 18 Indian soldiers in Manipur on June 4, the fear-gripped Paraolon villagers near the ambush site have taken shelter at P/Ralringkhu in Chandel district. The story has been flooded in the media all over. Northeast Today brings to you what is missed out â€“ the tale of a village once inhabited by innocent people and now by only fear.Recently, Manipur hit the headlines of national and regional media alike, albeit, for wrong reasons. NSCN (K) militants dared ambush and kill the Army jawans who were on their way back after handing over the camp to a different regiment. Media was seen flooded with reports of the incident and the subsequent avenging operation by the Army which is still mired in controversy.Whether the operation by Army has been successful in instilling fear in the minds of the militants or not is still a question but it surely has affected the lives of many locals for sure. The two vehicles damaged in the ambush have been dragged up to Paraolon and stationed there, thereby increasing the Army movement in the area. And with the state which has a history of conflicts and above all the imposition of the draconian law, Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) this has nothing but superimposed fear in the minds of the villagers.â€œThe Army men came up the other day and blurted out the names of their comrades killed in the ambush. It was a very scary moment for us. I donâ€™t blame them and we donâ€™t know who did this, but I am scared to death about its fallout,â€ said Reangtulng, a farmer from Paraolon. He is one among the many villagers who decided to seek shelter in neighbouring P/Ralringkhu after being relocated to their native Paraolon on June 18 by the Chandel DC in a personal effort. â€œOnly about 20 people stayed back in Paraolon, mostly elders,â€ he added.Paraolon is a small village in the hills of Chandel, about 30-40 km from the district headquarters, with a population of just 350 heads. It was this very village which first bore the brunt of the ethnic clashes in Chandel district in 1993. The village has also witnessed burnt down at least three times till date. It was a continuity of this fear psychosis which could be seen in the body language of the innocent villagers as they recalled their tryst with the recent ambush.â€œLetâ€™s not take sides, both Nagas and Kukis suffered back in 1993, but it is us the innocent villagers who suffer the most when two sides clash. We suffered as innocent people, not as Nagas or Kukis. When the Army and militants clash, we suffer as innocents,â€ said James Dilbung, chief of the Paraolon village.Many of the families from Paraolon, now taking shelter at P/Ralringkhu, no longer care for the education of their children or their agriculture as they believe life is more precious than education. Larsing, chairman of the Eastern Lamkang Chiefâ€™s Association says, â€œThere are so many ministers and MLAs, yet none has ever come here to even inquire about the plight of the Paraolon people. Since 1993, people in Paraolon live in a fear psychosis, yet the government has done literally nothing till date.â€Interestingly, two days before the ambush, the Assam Rifles had gunned down a Chandel woman activist named Ruisuting Aimol alias Mary for which Chandel observed shutdown just a day before the attack. Post-ambush, nobody knows what the Army has been doing in and around Paraolon. The only source of information so far has been the Army press releases themselves.Ironically, even as these press releases never mention the exact number of militants killed, the media are able to come up with their own claims of the number of militants killed. Commenting on the incident Pradip Phanjoubam, editor of Imphal Free Press says, â€œThe publicity hype was unnecessary. There was a gulf between what the Army said and what the government claimed. The role of media, especially the TV channels was shameful. They were simply swallowing everything the government fed them with.â€ Between the apathy of the government, the callousness of the armed parties on both sides and the senseless frenzy of the media, it is the innocent villagers who continue to suffer helplessly, depending for their lives on the charity of another village.Bimol Akoijam, Associate Professor of Social Sciences at JNU, puts it clearly, â€œThere are two lessons that one must know about AFSPA. First, it doesnâ€™t help the military to fight insurgents as such. For that matter, even to have a â€˜surgical strikeâ€™, you donâ€™t need AFSPA; what you need is intelligence, and expertise to carry out operation. Second, the deployment of military under AFSPA is not in â€˜the aid of civil authorityâ€™. The post ambush operation once again shows you the real face of the political paradigm to use army as a regular instrument of administration. These are the real dangers of AFSPA.â€ What the nation, the Army, the government, the media and the militants have forgotten about is that the common man has to bear the brunt at the end of the day. So much has been lost, so much has been deserted; and Paraolon is just another addition in the list of yet another village of the past."

Muivah, General Secretary of NSCN (IM), also on behalf of Chairman Isak Chishi Swu, during the signing ceremony of the framework agreement with the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, as witness at his 7 Race Course Road home in New Delhi. Muivah assured the Indian delegation, on behalf of the Naga people, that the â€œNagas can be trustworthyâ€ and can be taken into confidence for â€œany policy in the Northeast and beyond the frontiers.â€ The signatories to the agreement were Isak Chishi Swu and Th. Muivah on behalf of the NSCN (IM) while the Government of Indiaâ€™s signatory was its interlocutor to the Naga Peace talks, R.N. Ravi. The Press Information Bureau (PIB) reported that the entire top leadership of the NSCN (IM), including all members of the collective leadership, have â€œfully endorsedâ€ the agreement and were present during the ceremony.Within this framework agreement, details and execution plan will be released shortly, informed the PIB. Union Home Minister, Rajnath Singh, National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval and others were also present at the event. NSCN (IM) chairman Isak Chishi Swu, also a signatory to the agreement, could not make it to the ceremony as he is unwell and undergoing treatment at Fortis hospital in Delhi. His son Pasheto Swu was, however, present.â€œThe Naga political issue had lingered for six decades, taking a huge toll on generations of our people,â€ said Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, while speaking on the occasion. He admitted that â€œthe Naga problem has taken so long to resolve because we did not understand each other.â€ Modi spoke of his vision for the transformation of the northeast region and expressed confidence that the agreement will open â€œa glorious new chapter for the Naga people to build a bright future for Nagaland.â€Speaking on the occasion, Th. Muivah thanked Narendra Modiâ€™s â€œvisionary leadershipâ€ in coming â€œclose to understanding each otherâ€ as well as working out a â€œnew relationship between the two parties on the basis of this uniqueness.â€ â€œWe appreciate your wisdom, your leadership and your vision to build an enduring relationship between the Nagas and Indians. The Nagas will ever remember you for your statesmanship and your profound understanding of the Nagas,â€ he said.Muivah maintained that the obligations to â€œmeet the needs of the people shall be paramount for both the partiesâ€ in order to make the endeavour â€œmore meaningful.â€ He also assured that the Nagas can â€œstill come closer if their rights are respected.â€ In a separate statement released to the media, Muivah thanked the Naga people for their â€œunparalleled supportâ€ and stated that the framework agreement has been â€œconcludedâ€ based on â€œthe unique history and position of the Nagas and recognizing the universal principle that in a democracy sovereignty lies with the people.â€Framework Agreement is the Main Principle on Which Issues will be Worked Out: NSCN (IM) emissary to the collective leadership Gen (retd) VS Atem termed the framework agreement signed between NSCN (IM) and the Government of India (GoI) as the â€œpreambleâ€ based on which a final solution to the uniqueness of the Naga history and political rights is to be reached.â€œDetails are still being worked outâ€¦the framework agreement will be the main principle within which issues will be worked out,â€ Atem said, while speaking to The Morung Express from Delhi. The emissary to the collective leadership to NSCN (IM) was also present during the signing of the agreement. With Nagaland state thrown into a tizzy as details on the contents of the framework agreement remained sketchy till Monday night, Atem said that details on the agreement would be made public by Tuesday.On the question of why Naga civil societies were not consulted on the â€˜suddenâ€™ agreement, Atem asserted that the NSCN (IM) had said that it would consult the civil societies in case of any â€œroad blockâ€ in the negotiation process.
 He said the framework agreement was signed because there was mutual respect and understanding between NSCN (IM) and the GoI of each otherâ€™s positions.We are yet to see the contents of the accord: The framework agreement took many by surprise, with the prime minister making a dramatic tweet: â€œI will be making a special announcement at 6:30 PM from RCR.â€ The Naga Peopleâ€™s Movement for Human Rights (NPHMR) chairman N. Krome said, â€œWe were all caught by surprise by the sudden announcement.â€ He said they were aware that something was happening â€œbut we did not realise that something like this would happen so soonâ€.A top leader of Nagalandâ€™s apex body of tribes on Monday hailed the â€˜peace accordâ€™ signed by the Indian government and the NSCN-IM, saying the Nagas were hungry for peace.But some Nagas wondered why there was so much silence before the accord was signed. Chuba Ozukum, president of Naga Hoho, an apex body, expressed happiness over the accord and hoped it will bring a lasting solution to the Naga problem.  â€œIt has been a long-standing desire of the people of Nagaland. However, it is difficult to say much as I am yet to see the contents of the accord,â€ he said. â€œThe people of the state have been longing for a peace accord for a long time,â€ he said.Former Nagaland chief minister S.C. Jamir said: â€œI am yet to see the contents of the accord. Without knowing that, it is difficult to comment.â€ He added: â€œI was not aware the accord was going to be signed today. It seems they have done it silently for reasons best known to them.â€ A leader of the Naga Students Federation said on the condition of anonymity: â€œThe announcement came as a shocker. The people of Nagaland have been longing for this. â€œNow we are waiting eagerly to see the contents,â€ he added.Naga Peace Accord should not Affect Neighbours: Thangso Baite, the Congress Lok Sabha member from Outer Manipur, on Monday cautiously welcomed the peace accord between the government and the the NSCN-IM, saying it should not affect the neighbouring states. â€œWe were anxiously awaiting the peace accord provided it does not affect the neighbouring states,â€ the MP from a constituency that has a large Naga population told IANS here. â€œIf it affects the neighbouring states, it cannot be a peace solution,â€ Baite said alluding to the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivahâ€™s (NSCN-IM) earlier demand for a â€˜Greater Nagalimâ€™ that should include areas with Naga population in the neighbouring states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur. He said he was â€œnot sure which direction the Indian government was takingâ€.-Agencies"

Left with no other option, we filed a missing report at Tura police stationâ€, the victimâ€™s family said.According to her own admission, the girl was lured by Jinjin who later confined her to a house in a locality on the outskirts of Tura, West Garo Hills (WGH). She was forced to drink and forced to sleep with different men every day since the ordeal started.
 â€œI was forced to drink and have sexual intercourse with multiple partners every dayâ€, said the 16 year old after being rescued.
 The victimâ€™s family later said that their daughter was taken to different localities within Tura town every day and was left alone with men, who had exploited her physically.While the family frenetically searched for their daughter, all their initial efforts came to naught. However, a breakthrough came when a person informed the family that the girl was seen with Jinjin. They then made an elaborate plan to rescue their daughter and nab her kidnapper.â€œWe opened a fake account on Facebook pretending to be a young boy and started our conversation with Jinjin. We started our talks on whether she can provide any girls. She informed that she has a young girl and after an agreement on money, we would be allowed to spend a night with this girlâ€, a family member said.After a few days the ploy seemingly worked when Shira confirmed that she could bring a young girl to a locality in Tura. â€œWe asked her to bring the girl and later rescued her on Monday eveningâ€, victimâ€™s father said. After being caught, Shira confessed to her crime and was later handed over to the Tura police station. The police have registered a case under section 66A, 342, 368/34 of IPC for wrongful confinement and kidnapping. The case is being handled by Tura women police cell.â€œWe have applied the section based on the FIR which was filed earlier by the family. We will record the detailed statement of the victim and their family and apply an appropriate sectionâ€, said the Superintendent of Police (SP) of WGH, Mukesh Singh. Shira was produced in the Court on Tuesday and sent to seven days police custody.-MT"

 NET Bureau, Sandeep ChatterjeeMeghalaya has always been politically interesting; be it the toppling of governments or tussles for the chief ministerial seat. The state has always managed to keep political watchers up on their heels. Here is a look at the latest from the stateâ€™s coffer â€“ the Village Administration Bill, which has caused quite a furor.The traditional system of governance is deeply rooted to the Khasi way of life. The recent questioning of its authority by the high court, has led many a people to rethink about the status of traditional governing bodies of the state. The traditional bodies â€“ known as dorbars draw its roots since the age of the kings before democracy had any relevance in the state. But with time even the dorbars moulded itself with the changing times, from monarchy to democracy. Today, it exists parallel to the democratic design of the state but how relevant is its existence is the question of the hour. Since ages now the dorbars have been executing their duties of looking after the localities at a micro level.Though not constitutionally recognized, yet these dorbars have relentlessly worked for the uplift of the society for many years now. Deeply knitted with the Khasi traditions, culture and roots, it is also regarded as an institution that safeguards and archives the fast depleting cultural values in todayâ€™s world. Be it any funeral or marriage, water scarcity or garbage disposal, youth development or law and order; the durbars can be best described as the stepping stones of governance in Meghalaya.In contemporary times, it works hand in hand with the government and constitutional institutions in implementation and check of various schemes. And above all, the durbars function with neither any financial assistance nor managerial assistance from the government. For many years now this system was going on smoothly until the recent high courtâ€™s question on the source of dorbarâ€™s authority. It is true that India is a democracy and the functioning of dorbars more or less attributes to monarchy but it also stands true that the dorbars have nothing but helped the government in its functioning.With questions being raised on its authority the whole state has turnedin to constitutionally recognise the authority of the dorbars. However, there has become a divide among these people as the Village Administration Bill seems to be, according to some quarters, is drawn by sentiments rather than proper research and consultation. The state is now divided as the association of the headmen, Rangbah Shnong, the district councils and the government has locked horns regarding the contents of the Bill.â€œNo doubt, the Bill is required but its contents have to be scrutinised. Some of its contents are uncommon and confusing as it is drawn through sentiments and lacks proper research, therefore, we believe it should be redrafted properly so that everyone benefits from it,â€ said Bindo M Lanong, working president of the United Democratic Party.For the people it is all hay wire, as there are many who have not yet understood the problem and reason of all these commotion. The state has seen it all shutdowns, public gathering, hunger strike and so on which has compelled the government to rethink about the bill. The Bill, which has been passed by the district council was sent back by the government for reconsideration as some of the sections and clauses, according to the government, needed to be deleted. However, the council and the association of the headmen are for its immediate acceptance by the government without any changes.The Village Administration Bill was first introduced in the state when the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Government of India sent the draft Meghalaya Village Council Act 2011 to the state government with a request for its approval and implementation. Based on lines closer to the Panchayati Raj system, this bill aimed at strengthening the democratic process in the state. However, the district councils unanimously chose to oppose the enactments as they felt contrary to the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and to the prevailing traditional practices, customs and the usages of the tribal communities of the state. Therefore, in response to this the Executive Committee of Khasi Hills District Autonomous
 Council constituted its own Village Administration Bill 2011 which was passed in the summer of 2014.â€œThe bill is absolutely fine, there is no confusion, but still the government is delaying to pass it on the floor of the house. I fail to understand their dilemma, may be they are not committed to the cause,â€ says Michael Syiemiong, an active member of one of the dorbars in the state.It is true that the non-functioning of dorbars for quite some time now has taken its toll among the residents of different localities. And the noncooperation by the dorbars with the government until they resolve to pass the Bill is nothing but harassing the common men in the end. It is the common men who are bearing the brunt of this tussle between the government, ADCs and the traditional bodies over the Village Administration Bill. There is some respite for the state as the bill now rests with the Governor and the people are hopeful that he will take steps in favour of the betterment of the state and its people. Even the traditional institutions have shown some trust on the Governor and called-off all their agitations till the Governor comes up with anything concrete. But come what may the council and the traditional bodes are bent on the passing of the Bill. â€œWe want the turmoil in the state to end soon. The dorbars are important to us; it has been here for so many years now. The government should sort out the matter soon and give the durbars their dueâ€, Nachiketa Roy, a resident of Laban, said.Whatever be the cause, the solution to this problem needs to be sought soon. The common man is feeling the heat with continuous protests and the trademark shutdowns of the state. All eyes are now on the Governor to take a step in the right direction. As for the state it still awaits its long-practiced traditions to be recognised by the democracy."

ANVC and ANVC(B), both part of the peace accord, officially disbanded on December 15, 2014.
 As per the peace pact, ANVC demanded for the expansion of powers of the GHADC and an increased number of membership from 29 to 40 which would also have representation from the local tradition institutions. Also, members of the outfit would be eligible to contest for the seats, whileOf the 40 seats, the ANVC proposed that members to 35 should be directly elected, while those to the remaining five &#8211; reserved for two ANVC members, two Nokmas and one woman &#8211; should be nominated.However, to accommodate the agreed clauses under the peace pact, amendment to Sixth Schedule of Indian Constitution is required. Hoping that the Centre would make these amendments soon, repeated extensions were provided until the Centre recently informed the state that the actual amendment of the relevant provisions of the Sixth Schedule would take more time and the State Government may therefore not wait further and consider holding the election as and when it deemed fit.-MT"

Some former drug users, who are now on the path of rehabilitation, have revealed that drugs are easily available on the city streets.A former drug user, who is in the final stage of rehabilitation, disclosed that one gram of heroin was available in the city at the rate of Rs.1300-Rs.1500 when he got addicted to it but the price could have gone up to Rs.1500-Rs.1800, considering inflation.
 The ex-drug users claimed that heroin was easily available in any part of Shillong and could be obtained easily without any difficulty at any time. â€œDrug peddlers often stop supply of heroin to addicts so that they can charge higher prices later from the desperate customers,â€ they revealed.The drug peddlers arrive at a designated location in the city and all drug users go and collect their dose and the deal is sealed promptly and the buyers and sellers disperse as quickly as they had arrived. The peddlers change their locations regularly to keep the police off their backs.â€œEven home delivery of drugs is available. You just need to call the peddlers and they will come and deliver the drugs at your doorstep,â€ another user disclosed, while adding that the menace can be solved only if a mechanism can be devised to prevent smuggling of drugs into the city from the Indo-Myanmar border through Manipur and Nagaland.The ex-users revealed that the drug peddler usually lured potential customers by offering them heroin free of charge for few days and once they get addicted and fail to resist the urge, the peddlers start charging them money. These former drug addicts admitted that though they were despised as criminals and thieves they could lead healthy and normal lives if shown the right path. The former drug users came forward to share their experiences during a programme organized here on Saturday by Narcotics Anonymous.An ex-user revealed that he started with a cigarette while he was a student of Class 1 and had no idea that he would grow into an addict. â€œYou can be social drinker but you canâ€™t be a social drug user,â€ said the young guy who is on the path of recovery.
 Narrating his experiences, he said that during his period of addiction he was only concerned with three things â€“ how to get money for buying drugs, how to get the drugs and how to use them without being detected.â€œI wanted to stop the addiction but I could not and then I realized that my addiction would be over only with my death,â€ he said, while adding that hopes resurfaced only after he came into contact with Narcotics Anonymous. A member of the Narcotics Anonymous informed that they take recourse to a 12-step programme that does not include any medical treatment.The member revealed that the situation was alarming since there were around 8,000 registered drug users in Shillong city alone with thousands others unregistered. The member also stated that any person who wished to reach out to Narcotics Anonymous can do so by logging into www.naindia.in or by calling 09891122308.-TST"

The convoy had passed through Rongjeng town in East Garo Hills, approximately 12 km away, and was moving through an isolated stretch of the highway at Nongshram Aâ€™ding, when suspected GNLA militants perched atop hilltops overlooking the road opened up from automatic weapons at around 10 am.The firing damaged two police vehicles but the alert personnel  jumped out of the vehicles and took up positions as soon as the first shots hit the convoy. The exchange of fire lasted for some time as the armed battalion personnel returned fire on the militantsâ€™ positions before the attackers melted into the jungles nearby. Police reinforcements from nearest town Rongjeng as well as from distant West Khasi Hills district headquarters Nongstoin were rushed towards the ambush site for cordon and search operations.Later, police teams climbed up a hill to the place where the militants had kept wait.

Recently we found out that these rare bats are multiplying and a good number of newborns were sighted,&#8221; biologist and researcher Khlur Mukhim said.During the cave expedition last week, over 10 baby bats were found in the colony, he said.  The news was hailed by international researchers who felt the state government should undertake intensive efforts for protecting the environment in and around the area.&#8220;It is indeed very good news that the Otomops (Wrougton&#8217;s free tailed bats) are breeding in Meghalaya. Great care should be taken in protecting the endangered species, so as not to further compromise with their vulnerability,&#8221; an England-based researcher and biologist Adora Thabah Tyler said.  &#8220;I do feel that considering their numbers it will not take a lot for them to be disturbed as they would be and are very sensitive to noise and light,&#8221; she said.According to the researchers, these bats usually leave their colony after sunset and return to the caves during twilight hours. So the exercise to verify the presence of the babies was conducted after sunset when the adult bats had left the colony leaving the mothers and newborns back.Last week, as predicted, Mukhim found a number of babies and a few lactating mother bats, babysitting and guarding them at night, when all other bats had left to forage for food.

Police have started preliminary investigation on Tuesday itself, but sources said that there is a need to have a high level probe into the matte since the antique and unique items went missing over the past several years.An official source said on Wednesday that the theft of museum pieces may have taken place before CCTV was installed in the museum before September 2008. However, questions are being raised as to why the AG detected the matter only this year since the museologist who took over in 2009 had remarked in the Accession Register that several items registered as brought to the State  Museum were not available in the Museum. The Accession Register has the data from 1976.A few of the unique gold ornaments were donated by D. Singh IAS who was Deputy Commissioner, Tura in 1976. As per official records, the State Museum, Shillong was first established in 1975, under the Department of Education  and housed in the Legislative Assembly building. Initially, it was a small gallery with the display of a few collections.When the Arts and Culture department was created in 1988, the entire exhibits were shifted to the State Museum building.
 Earlier, the officers of Accountant General, Shillong had inspected records of the Director, Arts and Culture department for the period from August 2011 to December 2014.As per the scrutiny of records carried out by the officers of Accountant General from February to March this year, Accession Register was maintained by Arts and Culture department. But the value of antiquities received as gifts was not evaluated and hence the value of the antiquities in the Accession Register was kept blank.The audit party carried out a joint physical verification of antiquities along with the officials of the Arts and Culture department. Several items were found missing as per the verification. The Accountant General suggested a thorough inquiry to be initiated by the Arts and Culture department.-TST"

The decision was taken at a meeting of coal miners convened by the State Co-ordination Committee of Coal Owners, Miners and Dealers Forum (SCCCOMDF) held here in the city on Wednesday following the recent NGT order which stated clearly that the ban on coal mining will not be lifted unless the state government comes up with the mining plan.Announcing the decision, SCCOMDF chairman Sonny Khyriem said, â€œSince nothing was done for the last 15 months, we have decided to give a deadline to the state government till August 31.â€ He expressed concerned that despite the NGTâ€™s repeated orders directing the state government to come up with the state mining management plan, nothing was done.â€œIn almost every hearing whether in Delhi or in Shillong, the learned counsel of the state government always has to face the music of the NGT court whereby he used to ask time and again, give time to the state government to prepare the mining management plan,â€ Khyriem said.â€œWe therefore request the state government to come up in letter and spirit in as far as the mining management plan is concerned to make it public and make it known to us also,â€ Khyriem urged while adding, â€œFailing which, we will be compelled to seek permission from the NGT that we as a forum and on behalf of the miners will prepare a mining management plan by ourselves and let the NGT take a call on this effect.â€Khyriem said that this can be implemented on a trial basis for one or two years even as he stated that even the coal miners are concerned about their livelihood and the environment. Khyriem also pointed out that even as the environment needs to be protected, the coal miners too have to make a living. It is in this context that Khyriem said that the two have to co â€“ exist.He also stated that NGT has very clearly stated in its order that this will be the last and final exemption in as far as payment of royalty and transportation of coal is concerned, if the government is inactive and fails to respond. â€œIt is to this effect, we had passed a resolution that we will give the state government till August 31 to make it publicly known that they are coming up with the management plan to be submitted to the NGT as on September 29 and 30, there will be a hearing in Shillong, where we expected the government to present the mining and management plan,â€ he maintained.â€œHowever, if the government continues with its old false promises which it made time and again we will be forced to file a petition requesting the NGT to grant us permission where we the miners will prepare the mining and management plan on behalf of the state,â€ Khyriem reiterated even as he questioned as to how long the miners can wait for the government to do the needful.
 When asked whether the forum is equipped with the required expertise for the preparation of the mining plan, Khyriem said, â€œIf we are compelled then we should be ready with itâ€¦ the expertise will be only from the government recognized institute who will design, survey and prepare the mining plan for the state. We will go to them and present the mining plan to the NGT.â€Meanwhile, the miners have alleged that the state government had misinterpreted the recent NGT order and has come up with an order disallowing transportation of already extracted coal from Wednesday. â€œThe government has misinterpreted the order passed by the NGT as we have been informed that transportation of already extracted coal has been stopped today (Wednesday),â€ Khyriem said.He said that the order issued on July 31 by the NGT had stated â€“ â€˜The time for payment of royalty is extended up to September 30 and transportation up to November 30.â€™ According to him, the order passed by the NGT actually means that whoever has completed payment of royalty is allowed to transport already extracted coal up to November 30. Khyriem also informed that the forum will soon meet the chief secretary for his clarification on the matter.-MT"

He informed that since the proposed land to be acquired is located right at the centre of a market in Mawkyrwat, the NGOs from the area had also strongly protest against the move by the council to change the location to Rangmaw, which is 5km away from Mawkyrwat.Earlier, the PDF had also alleged that ARPA had failed to make public the inquiry report which has found that there is no scam involved in the implementation of the Khasi Heritage Village at Mawphlang. Regarding this allegation, Basaiawmoit said that the ARPA had no political agenda against anybody by instituting an inquiry to investigate into the alleged scam in the implementation of the heritage village project at Mawphlang.â€œWe have instituted the inquiry based on an RTI finding that alleged misappropriation of funds in the implementation of the project. The inquiry is to find out the truth,â€ he said while reacting to the allegation of the PDF that the ARPA failed to make public the report of the inquiry which was submitted since January this year. Stating that ARPA had not made any allegations against anybody despite the RTI findings, he however said, â€œIt is not right on the part of the PDF to allege that ARPA decided to institute the inquiry with the intention to malign.â€-MT"

The average Mizo has only been using Internet broadband since the last six years. The biggest Internet service provider in Mizoram is BSNL which does not provide direct IP. This makes it rather obvious that it is impossible to make an accurate count of visitors of any site.Inkhel.com supposedly does not have any visitor from Mizoram!! Considering that Inkhel.com is mostly in Mizo language, this is an unbelievable tale told by Google analytics. This website has about 40,000 visitors daily, and it does not take much logic to figure out that most of the visitors would be Mizos from Mizoram though there are a handful of visitors from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Guwahati and other places as well. That the Overview would show that there are no visitors of Inkhel.com from Mizoram tells of the pathetic condition of Internet service in Mizoram.Besides, the current condition of Internet in Mizoram does not really facilitate watching videos online. Very few privileged consumers can avail of the 4mbps plan which comes to about Rs. 1450 a month while the average user spends about Rs. 1000 a month on a plan with reduced services. Every consumer who uses BSNL broadband in Mizoram can attest for its irregularity and inefficiency, and mostly the excruciatingly slow speed of the Internet. Such circumstances make it impossible for users to watch videos. Inkhel.com has also noticed that interesting videos shared are viewed by only about 20% of visitors as the rest are most likely unable to. So, users prefer to download torrent videos instead of watching them online. And there is simply no way that Pornhub could count such downloads as part of their site traffic. Some people surmise that the survey must have been done percentage wise. But, this too does not seem plausible. The total population of Mizoram is a little over 10 lakhs out of which Internet users would hardly number up to a lakh. Users who have access to Internet with a tolerable speed are mostly concentrated in and around Aizawl. And it would be a very generous suggestion to say that such users would be around 3000 or 4000 if a headcount was to be made. They amount upto just 0.3 to 0.4 % of the total population.According to Pornhub, viewers from Mizoram mainly go for the Indian Sex category. This, again, is rather unbelievable. Most of the Mizo people who do watch porn do not watch Indian sex as they prefer foreign ones. This is evident from the CD Video libraries which were in vogue just some few years ago. These libraries never stacked Indian sex videos.Inkhel.com, therefore, asserts with conviction that the survey conducted by Pornhub is greatly flawed, and not to be believed.Source -inkhel.com"

The NSCN (IM) contingent in Bangladesh has about 50 male and female combatants who remain in a camp not far from the international border near Mizoramâ€™s western Mamit District, a senior official said.Another senior official said the contingent could either pass through Mizoram via Mamit town and Aizawl city, the state capital, or through Kolasib district, which borders Assam, depending on their chosen point of entry. There is as yet no confirmation about when the transit would be, however. This will not be the first time NSCN (IM) contingents have passed through Mizoram. They had passed through the state at least twice in the 1990s, both leading to encounters with security forces after which some members dispersed into the stateâ€™s interiors.They had also entered south Mizoram less than a decade ago during an internal disagreement that saw several alleged turncoats being murdered and some senior members of the group later arrested by Mizoram Police.The Mizo National Front, itself a former insurgent group, meanwhile said in a statement that both Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chishi Swu called former CM and MNF supremo Zoramthanga around 9.30 pm on Monday thanking him for his efforts towards a peace deal between the Indian Government and the NSCN(IM). The MNF also congratulated the leaders over the peace deal and wished them the best that it would lead to a durable solution.-Indian Express"

 Condemning the culture, the government of India has recently ordered blocking of more than 800 porn websites in the country. The government&#8217;s move has been criticised harshly with some even calling it &#8216;Talibanisation&#8217; of India. On a world wide basis, it is said that India ranked at the fifth spot in number of visitors to the porn website.The Government of India has banned access to at least 857 websites it considers pornographic.

Months before, the Delhi-based Korean Culture Centre, India (KCCI) had sent an intimation to the Mizoram government for holding an extravaganza in Aizawl, the Capital of the State. This event was the outcome of the Korean Ambasssadorâ€™s visit to Mizoram and is a part of the Korean Cultural Exchange Programme.The word â€˜K-Popâ€™ is no stranger to Korean music fans across the globe, not only in India or particularly the North East region. However, for some of us unfamiliar to the term it simply stands for the Korean Pop music culture. A Korean television channel called Arirang was telecasted since the early 2000â€™s and it could be said that this was the beginning of the Korean influence and has had a great influence on viewers in the North East. In Mizoram, Korean series are dubbed in Mizo and is telecasted 24/7.The audition had begun back in April and closed in June. From all over India, there were 244 submissions of demos and from that, Delhi and Mizoram had the most demos/vidoes sent for this K-Pop comepetition. The gates were announced beforehand to be closed at 4 pm, an hour before showtime. But even at 3 oâ€™clock, the hall was packed beyond it! Eager fans from around Mizoram who had come to witness the event had to stand outside the hall, instead of going home. The show was hosted by Rini Hlondo and it was commenced with the traditional Mizo dance of Cheraw, beautifully performed, followed by short speeches given by Manisha Saxena IAS, Commissioner &#038; Secretary, Governor of Mizoram. Kim Kum Pyoung, Director of KCCI and the Minister of Mizoram state Mr. Lalrinmawia Ralte. Besides these, two Korean journalists were also present at the event.The special K-Pop guest who came all the way from South Korea was Hyemin Jung, a former member of the girl group Gavy NJ. Besides these, two Korean journalists were also present at the event. Sangtei Khuptong was the invited Mizo artist who performed two songs as well.Singing and dance contestants came from Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya apart from within Mizoram . The dance crews that participated in this contest were- Frozen, Dance Xenos, 4our, Army Girls, A5, R-Miracle, Zo-i(solo dance) and War1.For singing/rap category, Priyanka, Jared B, Lushai Diamonds, Bluzz, Carolina Norbu, Shradha Sinha and FMY participated. The Frozen crew (Mizoram) came first in the dance competition with the Dance Xenos (Assam) in second place and A5 (Mizoram) in the third place. Priyanka from Assam won the singing competition with her Korean song.All songs and raps were in Korean as well as dance tracks. The winner(s) will be heading towards New Delhi for the Grand Finale to be held on 28th of August and from here, the winner(s) will be flying off to South Korea.Not only this, the lucky winner will be gifted the SamsungS6 Edge 64 GB as well. An exception was made on this night which was never done elsewhere before. Dance Xenos who came second were given an exception and would also be participating in the grand finale.Hyemin Jung, the guest star of the event performed 3 songs before the results were out. She included one cover song of Park Bom from 2NE1, â€œYou and Iâ€. Before she did so, she said that she had heard that the Mizos were very familiar with the K-Pop girlband 2NE1 and so she would sing them one song of the  band member Park Bomâ€™s single. While performing, she also came off stage to greet the screaming fans. Hyemin Jung not only performed but also gave away her album CD to her Instagram followers whom according to her have commented on her photos before she came to Mizoram. She called out three lucky fans and gifted them her autographed CDs with warm hugs and kisses.Jared B(Mizoram), a 19 year old who was the second runner up in singing said that he came to know about the contest from Facebook. When asked if his singing and rapping were influenced by K-Pop, he gladly admitted that it was true and the reason being that K-Pop raps are not as vulgar and explicit as compared to western raps and it has all the elements he likes-singing, rapping and dancing. He also said,â€It was hell of an experience to perform on stage like that!â€.The winner of the dance contest in the North east Region, FROZEN crew from Aizawl  was formed on January 19, 2013.
 In short, it was a great evening for all!"

The recommendation was to economically help states that are faced by disadvantages of geography, international borders, low population density and other factors.Over the years, as Assam fragmented with Meghalaya being carved out of it as a state and Mizoram as a Union Territory (which later became a state), and new states emerged from the former kingdoms of Manipur and Tripura, political and economic demands grew for parity in places of turmoil. During these difficult decades, Arunachal Pradesh moved peacefully from being a Tract under the Assam governorâ€™s jurisdiction to the Northeast Frontier Agency (NEFA), and finally became a state in 1987. Sikkim merged with India in 1975, and in 2002, it became a part of the North Eastern Council.All the northeastern states along with Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh got the â€˜specialâ€™ tag. As a result of this, a large amount of money began to flow into these states. The Centre would grant 90% of the funds the â€˜special statusâ€™ states needed, while 10% were given as loans. In addition to this, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister and Arun Shourie was the planning minister, the first to hold charge of a new Northeast portfolio (then a department, and not a ministry), a special offer was designed, according to which every ministry would contribute 10% of its annual budget to the Northeast department.The money was to go to the non-lapsable central pool of resources in the department, which was to become the ministry of DoNER (department of the north-east region). It was the 14th Finance Commission that recommended the ending of the â€˜special statusâ€™ category and took out provisions under Normal Central Assistance (NCA) and Special Central Assistance (SCA). The chief ministers of the eight northeast states have opposed this, saying that it would â€˜drastically affect the finances in the northeast statesâ€™ and objected to the fact that the Centre would no longer make good the gap in non-plan revenue expenditure such as local development projects and programmes.A big worry of the states was that the large central subsidies that were going into medium-term and long-term infrastructure programmes and projects in these states (and quite likely into the pockets of the contractors, officials, politicians and â€˜militantsâ€™) would no longer come for specific projects, but will be a part of a larger transfer. We cannot forget that these states have a history of 30-50 years of conflict. As a result of the violence, they have lost out on opportunities for growth as well as innumerable lives and livelihoods.The calculations of the Centre and the finance commission suffer from a fundamental flaw when it comes to Mizoram.
 Itâ€™s simple: The â€™special categoryâ€™ issue is one of the key provisions of the 1986 landmark peace accord between the Mizo National Front (MNF) and the Government of India as well as the local government. The agreement has made Mizoram one of the most peaceful states in the country. In Clause 6 of the Mizoram Accordâ€™s Memorandum of Understanding, the status is spelt out: (a) The Centre will transfer resources to the new government â€¦ and this will include resources to cover the revenue gap for the year, (b) Central assistance for Plan will be fixed taking note of any residuary gap in resources â€¦The MNF, it may be recalled, revolted against India in 1966, and received arms, funds and training from, and in China and Pakistan. The Government of Indiaâ€™s response was nothing less than brutal, uprooting two-thirds of the civilian population from their homes, burning villages and settling them in new fenced-in protected villages or regrouping centres. This remains one of the most undocumented and unresearched parts of the Centreâ€™s campaign in Mizoram. That both sides showed courage and statesmanship to rise above the bitterness and bloodshed to sign a peace treaty 20 years after the first shots were fired needs to be recognised regularly. That the peace has been sustained for the overall part for nearly 30 years is no mean achievement and has happened because of the determination shown by a highly knowledgeable and educated public, the church, the governments of different parties and civil society.This is to be underlined, especially when conditions in parts of Manipur, Nagaland and Assam remain unsettled and unresolved. The latter represents a different set of issues and stories, which we shall not dwell upon here. Anything that vitiates or dilutes the Mizoram Accord, the only peace agreement to have held in more than a half century of conflict in the northeast and which has been passed by Parliament, is unacceptable. It is, therefore, heartening to note that the sub-committee of chief ministers set up by the Niti Aayog has tabled a draft report saying that for this category of states, the old formula should continue.Changing the status would create new problems: The question will surely be asked â€” what is the value of a peace accord if there isnâ€™t an economic dividend, let alone a political one? The Government of India needs to firmly assert that the interests of Mizoram and its special status compatriots will not be harmed.Sanjoy Hazarika is director, Centre for Northeast studies at Jamia Millia Islamia University.-HT"

Geology and mineral resources department director H. Lallenmawia said that the state&#8217;s 21,087 square km area is considered suitable for exploration of natural oil and gas and the region lies on the proven commercial productivity basin of the two natural resources.He added that the explorations activities by the different national and international agencies are spread around 58.9 per cent of Mizoram&#8217;s total area. Several agencies are active in exploration activities in Mizoram. These agencies are: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC), India Oil Company (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL), Suntera Resources Ltd, Shiv-Vani Oil Exploration, Nafto-gaz India Private Ltd, Reliance Energy Ltd, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd, Geopetrol International Inc. (French), and Oil &#038; Natural Gas Ltd.Lallenmawia said both the ONGC and IOC together were in the thick of extraction activity in around 5,340 square km area. Oil India Ltd (OIL), Suntera Resources Ltd and Shiv-Vani Oil Exploration cover 3,216 sq km, while the exploration activities of Naftogaz India Private Ltd, Reliance Energy Ltd, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd and Geopetrol International Inc. (French) are spread around 3,619 sq km. He said 255 sq km area had been earmarked for the Oil and Natural Gas Ltd.&#8220;The exploration of natural oil and gas will certainly bring development in the state. The state will also soon become self reliant in domestic cooking gas,&#8221; stated a paper recently presented by Lallenmawia in a seminar on oil and natural gas exploration in Aizawl. The director said under the New Exploration Licensing Policy, the state would get 12.5 per cent of wellhead price on crude oil and 10 per cent of wellhead price on natural gas as royalty. The wellhead price is the wholesale price natural gas at their time of production.Besides, as Lallenmawia said, the state will get 50 per cent share of the non-tax revenue against the production of oil and natural gas. The non-tax revenue is the recurring income earned by the government from sources other than taxes.- The Telegraph"

The letter addressed to the PWD SDO at Ratu has demanded a donation of Rs 1 lakh, sources said, while the demand letters addressed to the VCPs asked them to collect 5% of funds meant for all job-card holders in their respective jurisdictions and hand it over to the group or its representatives at Sihpuikawn, near Tipaimukh in neighboring Manipur.Mizoram is separated from Manipur by the Tuivai and Tuiruang (Barak) rivers, and Sihpuikawn lies east of the point where these two converge. One of the recipients has told police a middle-aged woman in a vehicle delivered the letters on behalf of the militant group, which was responsible for the March 28 ambush on a convoy of three MLAs that killed three policemen and injured six others, including two civilians.Meanwhile, Mizoram DGP Dharmendra Kumar said at a meeting of SPs and battalion commandants in Aizawl on Friday that the state police will continue to pressure the militant group until they are â€œon their kneesâ€. Saying the groupâ€™s latest move suggests they have â€œagain become a little activeâ€, DGP Kumar said, â€œI hope it is not because we have lessened our pressure. We cannot let it go at this stage.â€ The Mizoram Police had retaliated against the HPCD by mounting a covert operation and shooting to death â€œSergeantâ€ H C Malsawmkima alias Danny, a 31-year-old man suspected to have led the lethal ambush along with the groupâ€™s â€œWestern Commanderâ€ L Biaka, in early May at a village on the Manipur-side of the Barak riverâ€™s bank.Malsawmkima was a constable with the state policeâ€™s armed wing before he fled from the camp at Sakawrdai last year with two guns and joined the militant group. â€œOur teams have been so effective that the underground is now running around trying to seek talks again. They are scared of us, they are scared of the Mizoram Police, it was only because of our response that they have come to this kind of a situation. It is only because we have arrested their top leaders and managed to keep them behind bars,â€ the DGP said. Mizoram Police  had on April 16, less than three weeks after the ambush, arrested the HPCDâ€™s â€œArmy Chiefâ€ Lalropuia Famhoite and â€œFinance Secretaryâ€ Norbar Sanate from near Silchar town in south Assam. They are currently in judicial custody and Famhoite currently faces dozens of criminal charges in two districts, Aizawl and Kolasib.The HPCD had last month approached the state government with offers for conditional tripartite talks involving itself, the state government and the Centre, with even itâ€™s chairman Zosangbera making telephone calls to police investigators to help facilitate the talks. The state government has however rejected the offers saying they must be unconditional and only between the state and the HPCD. Meanwhile, the HPCDâ€™s long-standing interlocutor Lalmuanpuia Punte, currently chief of the Zoram Nationalist Partyâ€™s youth wing, met Union MoS for Home Kiren Rijiju on July 21 to talk about the Hmar â€œpolitical issueâ€ (the militant group claims to be fighting for an Autonomous District Council for the Hmar tribe) according to a post on Virthli.in, a web portal that largely publishes posts about the Hmar community.-Indian Express"

The federation also fails to understand as to why the state government is so adamant or reluctant to deliver basic justice demanded by the federation, it said. The ENSF added that lack of political will in the state government in attending the needs of the poorer section of the Naga society had distorted Nagaland beyond repair.The ENSF reiterated that if the reservation policy had been implemented efficiently in the past 38 years, equality would have existed in the state today. And if the state government is reluctant to fulfil the demand of the federation, then inequality will â€œcontinue to exist for another centuries and the state government itself shall be termed as the mother of all manipulation and deprivation,â€ it said.The ENSF further asserted that the federation is not demanding for a special privilege but a right guaranteed under the Article 16(4) of the Indian Constitution. The resentment shown by the ENSF is against the failure of the successive governments of Nagaland in implementing the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Indian Constitution to deliver justice to â€˜backward tribesâ€™ of the Eastern Nagas, it said.The ENSF also informed that as resolved during the 13th Federal Assembly, it has endorsed and empowered all the six federating units to carry out the proposed agitation in their respective jurisdiction starting on August 13. In this regard, it directed all the Eastern Nagas to â€œstrictly adhere on any directives issued by the respective students union during the period of agitation.â€The ENSF further informed that once the agitation is kicked off, the federation would not entertain any invitation from the state government on the issue but â€œshall process for rendezvous at the highest level.â€ â€œHence, in the event of any untoward incidents, the state government shall  be solely held responsible,â€ it cautioned.-MExN"

The letter sought to know why the signed agreement was not made public so far.Though sources indicated that such requests can always be turned down as the Right to Information Act exempts the government from making disclosures that can impinge upon national security, the home ministry may have to perforce reject this as it knows little about the terms of the â€œframework agreementâ€ signed on Monday. Ravi did brief home minister Rajnath Singh and home secretary LC Goyal explaining that it was only a â€œframeworkâ€ to proceed with further negotiations. However this has done little to dispel confusion within the home ministry brass on the â€œagreed way forwardâ€.The home ministry was forced to write to the interlocutor on Friday, seeking details of the accord and its impact on the ceasefire ground rules in force in Nagaland.

Atem said that sharing of â€œsovereign powersâ€ between India and Naga people have been defined in the competencies of the Framework Agreement and considerable headway has been made in this regard.Asked on some of the â€œsovereign powersâ€ that would be vested on Nagas, Atem said â€œland and resourcesâ€ was one of the competencies that Nagas would enjoy. He, however, declined to comment on other sovereign powers of the Nagas stating that finer details were being worked out on the competencies, which would be premature to divulge at this stage.Atem, however, said that both sides have agreed to forge a new relationship as â€œequal partners.â€ He added that both sides have also concurred that in the contemporary world situation, no country in the world can claim to possess absolute sovereignty and that peaceful co-existence is more important.â€œIn the past it was taboo to talk about â€˜co-existenceâ€™ but today they (GoI) also said we need to work for peaceful co-existence. If Nagas come under India, there is no meaning to the word â€œtwo entities.â€™ Even the GoI has no problem on this issue,â€ the senior NSCN leader said. Nagas will not be coming within India. India and Nagas would be equal partners not in terms of size and strength but in terms of exercising political autonomy, he said.On the integration of Naga inhabited areas, Atem said the issue is still very much alive on the negotiating table. â€œHow can we leave that out? Are we seeking solution through approval of Meiteis or others? The land of Nagas was divided without their consent and we have every right to live together. We will continue to fight till Nagas achieve this aspiration,â€ he said.Meanwhile, the Hindustan Times reported the NSCN (IM) leader as stating that the Naga Hoho be made a statutory authority. â€œIt will undergo a transformation from a being merely a social body to a statutory body with legislative, executive and financial powers,â€ he was quoted as saying.The report further informed that Atem favoured a separate flag. â€œIf Kashmir can have a separate flag, why not Nagas? China also has separate flags for Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. But a separate currency is not feasible.â€
 â€œArticle 371A â€¦ endows special status to Nagalandâ€¦But when it comes to oil or gas or rivers, the Centre says these are national resources. So 371A is not acceptable. The Constitution has to be suitable amended giving genuine powers to Nagas,â€ Atem was further quoted as saying.Naga people will be Informed: The NSCN (IM) leader meanwhile assured that the Naga people would be informed on the progress of the peace talks and on the broad framework of the agreement.â€œThe peace agreement was made on behalf of the Naga people and since the issue belongs to the people why should we hide anything. In a couple of days we will inform the Naga public whichever is on the negotiating table,â€ he said. Atem said some of the NSCN leaders would be returning to Nagaland within the next two days and share the broad contours of the peace accord.He also disclosed that the Framework Agreement had to be signed with a sense of urgency due to the failing health of NSCN (IM) chairman, Isak Chishi Swu. â€œHe (Swu) was also worried and we were all the more worried about him. For 57 long years, he had led the Nagas without any second thought and so we wanted him to seal the deal (peace accord) based on which all subsequent negotiations will revolve,â€ the NSCN leader said.Atem further disclosed that Swu had to sign the accord in the hospital itself as the doctors did not want to take the risk of Swu travelling to 7 Race Course at that point of time. He expressed relief that chairmanâ€™s health had improved a lot since then.-MExN"

It is just the beginning of the solution,â€ Zeliang told reporters Sunday in New Delhi.The CM stressed on the need to solve the issue permanently, which would be possible only if there was no â€œpolitical influenceâ€. â€œIt is important that the settlement made is keeping in mind the Naga cultural system and based on their unique history. It is important that there is no political influence in the entire issue.â€ Zeliang further informed: â€œA delegation of 16 members from the civil society will meet NSCN (K) and, if required, the other factions too and try to persuade them to join the peace talks. The delegation consists of Naga Hoho, the apex body of all the Naga community, and one more group. They have been given the security clearance by the home ministry to travel to Myanmar and hold talks with the NSCN (K), which has significant presence in Nagaland.â€â€œI along with all members of the Nagaland Assembly are ready to step down, if an acceptable and honourable solution is found to the Naga people, in order to make a new beginning,â€ the CM further said. He stated that the final result of the Naga Accord was expected by the end of this year. He also said that allegations by Nagalandâ€™s neighbouring states that they were not consulted over the Naga accord were false and they were all aware of it. â€œThere is a difference between active participation and consultation. Consultation with the Northeastern states was very much there before signing the Naga accord,â€ he said.Asserting that the agreement will not affect non-Nagas and will resolve the problems of the North East, Zeliang said that he will speak to other chief ministers of the region. â€œThe pact signed by Centre and NSCN (IM) will help bring peace to the North-East. I will speak personally to my counterparts of neighbouring states to allay their apprehensions over the agreement,â€ Zeliang said.â€œSolving the Naga problem is solving the problems of the North-East. Non-Nagas of the North-East should not have any negative thinking about the pact,â€ he added. Zeliang said what he understood after meeting Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh was that the Naga political problem will be resolved through sharing of power between the government of India and the Naga people.Highlighting aspects of the formula, he said Naga customary system and land holding system will be respected by the Centre based on the â€œunique history of Nagasâ€ and will be applied across the Naga inhabited areas of the North East, including Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. â€œThis Naga issue does not pertain to only Nagaland. Naga problem is covering the entire Naga contiguous region. So, respecting the traditional land holding system, customary system, it covers the entire Naga (community) wherever they areâ€¦,â€ he said.

That it has happened under the leadership of Narendra Modi, with RN Ravi as the Centre&#8217;s interlocutor, and national security advisor Ajit Doval as the less-than-hidden hand, is to the credit of the current dispensation. Nevertheless, it is useful to recognise that this is, at best, the last step in a journey in which several successive regimes had already covered many miles. Crucially, moreover, it is far from a conclusive resolution of the &#8220;Naga problem&#8221;. While this deal is certainly historic in its significance, it is not the end of troubles in Nagaland. There are still several armed factions that will need to be accommodated before the Nagaland problem can be said to have been resolved, and at least some of these will be tempted to escalate violence in the immediate future, partially to increase their leverage in future negotiations, and partly to occupy the militant space purportedly vacated by the NSCN-IM, as a result of its accord with the government.The Congress&#8217; rather strident criticism of the accord has been both churlish and mischievous, and does not need to be taken seriously. Indeed, it is useful to reiterate that the present agreement would necessarily reflect a continuity of efforts and underlying principles established under previous regimes. Moreover, the NPA government did not &#8220;take the states into confidence&#8221; any more than the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has, and that is the nature of such negotiations. That this is &#8220;insulting to the states and people of the Northeast&#8221;, as Sonia Gandhi provocatively suggests, is nonsense. While the details of the deal will inevitably be shared, clearly, it cannot contain elements that would compromise the interests and territorial integrity of the neighbouring states, unless the principal state interlocutors and everyone in the central government have completely lost their minds. The NPA&#8217;s problem was &#8220;sour grapes&#8221;, because it wasn&#8217;t able to push the deal to a conclusion during its tenure &#8211; though they were many occasions when a settlement was believed to be tantalisingly within reach.The accord is expected to contain the basic provisions that have crystallised over the years, specifically, that the immediate deal will relate only to the territory of Nagaland, and that other territorial claims like that of &#8220;Greater Nagalim&#8221; will be resolved consensually through dialogue with neighbouring states. It is likely that the deal will pave the way to an election where the NSCN-IM or a successor political party will be facilitated to secure power through polls.There will now have to be a renewed focus on what the other Naga factions are likely to do. This deal will overwhelmingly favour NSCN(IM), and, at the same time, vacate a vast dissenting space which other groups &#8211; most significantly NSCN-K, but also the lesser formations, such as NSCN (Khole-Kitovi), NSCN-Reformation, NSCN-Reunification, Naga National Council (NNC), Zeliangrong Revolutionary Army, among others &#8211; will attempt to occupy. Further, the possibilities of a split within NSCN(IM) cannot be ruled out. It was, itself, born out of a peace deal: the Shillong Accord that the government had with the NNC in 1975, which some elements refused to accept, and came to create the then unified NSCN. When the loaves and cakes have been distributed, there will be many who feel they have lost out; it remains to be seen what they would do. The deal with the NSCN(IM) is also of critical importance for the insurgencies across the Northeast, because the group had become an opportunistic facilitator for a number of other insurgent formations in the region, and all these will suffer as a consequence of the loss of underground support from the NSCN(IM) faction. This may, however, mean that NSCN-Khaplang will gain in influence. Nevertheless, the much larger infrastructure and capacities of the NSCN(IM) group would now, hopefully, be lost to the other surviving insurgencies in the region as well.Crucially, the present agreement is likely to be no more than a basic &#8220;framework&#8221; agreement, spelling out the principles of concrete settlement. Vexing issues, among others, of dismantling the NSCN(IM) camps, of demobilising and disarming its armed cadre, of dismantling the parallel security, administration and taxation networks long operated by the NSCN(IM), will remain to be hammered out, and will not be easy to address, particularly since NSCN(IM) cadres are likely to plead that unless all other groups are disarmed they will need to retain their capacities to defend themselves. Such a position, however, would lead to a perpetuation of an unacceptable status quo on the ground.-dailyo.in"

The meeting is, however, likely to take place only after August 15.ENPO president S Khoiwang said the actual date for the meeting is yet to be confirmed but has been tentatively set for the latter part of August. The two Naga civil organizations will be requesting the NSCN (K) to resume the 2001 ceasefire with the Government of India which had been abrogated on March this year.It was just recently that the Nagaland State governmentâ€™s Parliamentary Working Committee of the Joint Legislatorsâ€™ Forum on the Naga political issue had resolved to appeal to the Naga Hoho and ENPO to meet with the NSCN (K) chairman and request him to resume the ceasefire talks with the GoI. It may also be recalled that NSCN (K) had abrogated the 14 year old ceasefire earlier this March, which had been signed in 2001. Following the abrogation a series of attacks on the security forces has been launched. One June 5 at least eighteen personnel of the Assam Rifles were killed in an ambush in Chandel district, Manipur.Khoiwang disclosed that Khaplang has assigned Lt Gen (retd) Khango Konyak, vice chairman of the organization and Lt Gen Niki Sumi, military supervisor to meet with the ENPO, Naga Hoho leaders. It is however highly unlikely that Chairman SS Khaplang will be physically present. According to sources, Khaplang is at the moment recuperating after undergoing medical treatment.â€œWe were told that the doctor have advised the NSCN (K) chairman to refrain from undertaking any activities until his health is fully recovered,â€ the ENPO president informed. A report from the Indian Express stated the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has given its nod to the move, stipulating that only designated access routes would be used and that the delegation carry proper travel documents.The ENPO president also elucidated that the decision of the Naga civil societies to meet with the NSCN (K) is not only because of the appeal from the Nagaland State government side or because they are a civil body, but because it is their duty to convey the wishes of the people. â€œWe have to speak to them for the people of Nagaland that they want peace and resumption of ceasefire with the GoI. If we donâ€™t meet them, if we donâ€™t tell them, it would be like telling them not to ask for ceasefire and bite bullets instead,â€ he stated.-MExN"

Zeliang who called on him in New Delhi on Friday. Zeliang was accompanied by Home minister, Y. Patton.
 â€œBefore the final agreement is signed with the NSCN (I-M) Chief Ministers of Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be taken into confidence,â€ sources said quoting the Home Minister as having said to Zeliang during a 20 minute meeting.Singh told Zeliang that the Central government has made it clear to NSCN (I-M) that their main demand of integration of Naga inhabited areas would not be met but more powers would be given to local bodies like autonomous district council, the sources said. This comes at a time when Congress which rules all the three states protested for not having consulted the neighbouring states of Nagaland before signing the initial accord with NSCN-IM.
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi had on Thursday accused Narendra Modi government for â€œinsultingâ€ the three North Eastern states, whose chief ministers belong to her party, as they were not taken into confidence before signing the agreement with NSCN (I-M).She charged the Modi dispensation with being â€œarrogantâ€ in not briefing Congress chief ministers of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Assam despite their states being â€œdirectly affectedâ€ by the pact.Sources said the Home Minister explained to the Chief Minister that a framework has been laid in the Mondayâ€™s agreement and the final pact will be signed only after detailed discussions in coming months.Sources said micro details of the peace plan will have to be worked out and will take some more time but said government is willing to consider devolution of more powers to Nagaland legislature under article 371 (A) which is already in force.According to PTI reports, Government was willing to consider autonomous Hill councils to help Nagas achieve cultural integration and have more say in how they are governed.Framework Agreement of the Naga Peace Accord was signed in the presence of the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval by NSCN (I-M) leader Th. Muivah and governmentâ€™s interlocutor for Naga talks, R.N Ravi at the PMâ€™s residence here.
 Further, in a press release, Chief Ministerâ€™s Office, Nagaland also informed that the chief minister met National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval and Interlocutor Naga Peace Talk, R.N. Ravi later in the evening.

 Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh also rushed to Delhi to meet Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and discuss with him the peace accord signed between the Centre and NSCN (I-M).The chief ministerâ€™s visit to the national capital has been confirmed by his secretariat.
 During the meeting, Ibobi is likely to discuss issues related to the peace accord, a government official said on condition of anonymity.Ibobi will also discuss with Rajnath the ongoing agitations in the state demanding implementation of inner line permit in the north eastern state, the official said.The agitations are being spearheaded by Joint Committee on Inner Line Permit System and have continued for over one-and-half month now during which one student was killed on July 8.

But if the peace in Nagaland is at the cost of our territories than we wonâ€™t let it happen,â€ Ninon Ering, Member of Parliament from East Arunachal Pradesh said. He said It should be understood that Nagas staying in any other state apart from Nagaland â€œare an integral part of that state as they have been staying there for years. Where does the demand for other states to give up its Naga-inhabited areas come from?â€ he asked.Noting that there were only four Naga tribes living in Arunachal Pradesh, including the Wancho, Tangsa and Nocte, Ering said: â€œAt most the government can allow them to have autonomous councils, but giving up those areas to Nagaland wonâ€™t be possible.â€ IANS spoke to a number of MPs from the region.On Monday, the NSCN-IM and the government had signed the Naga Peace Accord, settling an almost 20-year-old peace negotiation process that started in 1997 after the group signed a ceasefire agreement. NSCN-IM general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah, who signed the accord oat a ceremony at the prime ministerâ€™s 7 Race Course Road residence on Monday, had hailed it as a â€œmomentous occasionâ€.Thokchom Meinya, Member of Parliament from Inner Manipur constituency, said that the BJP-led government and the NSCN-IM were in â€œa hurry to settle their problems without realising the harm causedâ€ to other north-eastern states.â€œThe way government is trying to keep the content of the accord confidential clearly shows that it might have something which is not in favour of Nagalandâ€™s neighbouring states,â€ Meinya said. He added that the government should have at least informed Parliament before signing the accord with the NSCN-IM. â€œDiscussing in Parliament with all stake-holders was necessary,â€ he added.Nagaland shares its boundary with Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. At least three districts in Manipur &#8211; Ukhrul, Tamenglong and Senapati as well as two in Arunachal Pradesh &#8211; Tirap and Changlang &#8211; are Naga-inhabited districts.

The NSCN (IM) contingent in Bangladesh has about 50 male and female combatants who remain in a camp not far from the international border near Mizoramâ€™s western Mamit District, a senior official said.Another senior official said the contingent could either pass through Mizoram via Mamit town and Aizawl city, the state capital, or through Kolasib district, which borders Assam, depending on their chosen point of entry. There is as yet no confirmation about when the transit would be, however. This will not be the first time NSCN (IM) contingents have passed through Mizoram. They had passed through the state at least twice in the 1990s, both leading to encounters with security forces after which some members dispersed into the stateâ€™s interiors.They had also entered south Mizoram less than a decade ago during an internal disagreement that saw several alleged turncoats being murdered and some senior members of the group later arrested by Mizoram Police.The Mizo National Front, itself a former insurgent group, meanwhile said in a statement that both Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chishi Swu called former CM and MNF supremo Zoramthanga around 9.30 pm on Monday thanking him for his efforts towards a peace deal between the Indian Government and the NSCN(IM). The MNF also congratulated the leaders over the peace deal and wished them the best that it would lead to a durable solution.-Indian Express"

It is not a government. It is the ultimate national institution of the Nagas. As such, every Naga has a responsibility to uphold the Naga National Council,â€ Adinno said in a press statement. Substantiating this stand, Adinno recounted the history of the Naga National Council.It said NNC was formed on February 2, 1946 to hold the Naga people together in one platform as there was no central authority prior to this. In May, 1947 the emerging modern India sent her delegation of the Constituent Assembly of India to Kohima and met the NNC members, and made an offer to the Nagas to join the Union of India. The offer was refused, the press statement stated.In June 1947, the Ten-Years Agreement was given by the Indian representatives. NNC agreed with modification for 10 years but India broke off its promise with NNC. And before Great Britain handed over her power to modern India, the Naga representatives declared Naga Independence on August 14, 1947, a day ahead of modern India. AZ Phizo, on becoming the president of NNC in 1950, immediately began directing the course of NNC into a political consciousness and brought all regions (tribes) together as a nation. He next took a national referendum, because modern India alleged that only a few educated Nagas were talking about their independence.Consequently, national plebiscite was conducted on May 16, 1951 by giving a choice to the people to decide whether to stay independent or join India. The result was 99.9 percent not to join India. Phizo also brought in the Eastern Nagas to join the mainland and established the Federal Government of Nagaland on March 22, 1956, it maintained. In light of the above mentioned, the NNC stressed that the â€˜indisputable right the Nagas have is that Nagas are not Indians and Nagaland is not Indian Territoryâ€™ and asserted, â€˜the Nagas have every right to be a nation.â€™-MExN"

Muivah, General Secretary of NSCN (IM), also on behalf of Chairman Isak Chishi Swu, during the signing ceremony of the framework agreement with the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, as witness at his 7 Race Course Road home in New Delhi. Muivah assured the Indian delegation, on behalf of the Naga people, that the â€œNagas can be trustworthyâ€ and can be taken into confidence for â€œany policy in the Northeast and beyond the frontiers.â€ The signatories to the agreement were Isak Chishi Swu and Th. Muivah on behalf of the NSCN (IM) while the Government of Indiaâ€™s signatory was its interlocutor to the Naga Peace talks, R.N. Ravi. The Press Information Bureau (PIB) reported that the entire top leadership of the NSCN (IM), including all members of the collective leadership, have â€œfully endorsedâ€ the agreement and were present during the ceremony.Within this framework agreement, details and execution plan will be released shortly, informed the PIB. Union Home Minister, Rajnath Singh, National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval and others were also present at the event. NSCN (IM) chairman Isak Chishi Swu, also a signatory to the agreement, could not make it to the ceremony as he is unwell and undergoing treatment at Fortis hospital in Delhi. His son Pasheto Swu was, however, present.â€œThe Naga political issue had lingered for six decades, taking a huge toll on generations of our people,â€ said Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, while speaking on the occasion. He admitted that â€œthe Naga problem has taken so long to resolve because we did not understand each other.â€ Modi spoke of his vision for the transformation of the northeast region and expressed confidence that the agreement will open â€œa glorious new chapter for the Naga people to build a bright future for Nagaland.â€Speaking on the occasion, Th. Muivah thanked Narendra Modiâ€™s â€œvisionary leadershipâ€ in coming â€œclose to understanding each otherâ€ as well as working out a â€œnew relationship between the two parties on the basis of this uniqueness.â€ â€œWe appreciate your wisdom, your leadership and your vision to build an enduring relationship between the Nagas and Indians. The Nagas will ever remember you for your statesmanship and your profound understanding of the Nagas,â€ he said.Muivah maintained that the obligations to â€œmeet the needs of the people shall be paramount for both the partiesâ€ in order to make the endeavour â€œmore meaningful.â€ He also assured that the Nagas can â€œstill come closer if their rights are respected.â€ In a separate statement released to the media, Muivah thanked the Naga people for their â€œunparalleled supportâ€ and stated that the framework agreement has been â€œconcludedâ€ based on â€œthe unique history and position of the Nagas and recognizing the universal principle that in a democracy sovereignty lies with the people.â€Framework Agreement is the Main Principle on Which Issues will be Worked Out: NSCN (IM) emissary to the collective leadership Gen (retd) VS Atem termed the framework agreement signed between NSCN (IM) and the Government of India (GoI) as the â€œpreambleâ€ based on which a final solution to the uniqueness of the Naga history and political rights is to be reached.â€œDetails are still being worked outâ€¦the framework agreement will be the main principle within which issues will be worked out,â€ Atem said, while speaking to The Morung Express from Delhi. The emissary to the collective leadership to NSCN (IM) was also present during the signing of the agreement. With Nagaland state thrown into a tizzy as details on the contents of the framework agreement remained sketchy till Monday night, Atem said that details on the agreement would be made public by Tuesday.On the question of why Naga civil societies were not consulted on the â€˜suddenâ€™ agreement, Atem asserted that the NSCN (IM) had said that it would consult the civil societies in case of any â€œroad blockâ€ in the negotiation process.
 He said the framework agreement was signed because there was mutual respect and understanding between NSCN (IM) and the GoI of each otherâ€™s positions.We are yet to see the contents of the accord: The framework agreement took many by surprise, with the prime minister making a dramatic tweet: â€œI will be making a special announcement at 6:30 PM from RCR.â€ The Naga Peopleâ€™s Movement for Human Rights (NPHMR) chairman N. Krome said, â€œWe were all caught by surprise by the sudden announcement.â€ He said they were aware that something was happening â€œbut we did not realise that something like this would happen so soonâ€.A top leader of Nagalandâ€™s apex body of tribes on Monday hailed the â€˜peace accordâ€™ signed by the Indian government and the NSCN-IM, saying the Nagas were hungry for peace.But some Nagas wondered why there was so much silence before the accord was signed. Chuba Ozukum, president of Naga Hoho, an apex body, expressed happiness over the accord and hoped it will bring a lasting solution to the Naga problem.  â€œIt has been a long-standing desire of the people of Nagaland. However, it is difficult to say much as I am yet to see the contents of the accord,â€ he said. â€œThe people of the state have been longing for a peace accord for a long time,â€ he said.Former Nagaland chief minister S.C. Jamir said: â€œI am yet to see the contents of the accord. Without knowing that, it is difficult to comment.â€ He added: â€œI was not aware the accord was going to be signed today. It seems they have done it silently for reasons best known to them.â€ A leader of the Naga Students Federation said on the condition of anonymity: â€œThe announcement came as a shocker. The people of Nagaland have been longing for this. â€œNow we are waiting eagerly to see the contents,â€ he added.Naga Peace Accord should not Affect Neighbours: Thangso Baite, the Congress Lok Sabha member from Outer Manipur, on Monday cautiously welcomed the peace accord between the government and the the NSCN-IM, saying it should not affect the neighbouring states. â€œWe were anxiously awaiting the peace accord provided it does not affect the neighbouring states,â€ the MP from a constituency that has a large Naga population told IANS here. â€œIf it affects the neighbouring states, it cannot be a peace solution,â€ Baite said alluding to the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivahâ€™s (NSCN-IM) earlier demand for a â€˜Greater Nagalimâ€™ that should include areas with Naga population in the neighbouring states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur.

Flash floods triggered by the rains had claimed one live on Saturday.The affected area, which falls under Phokungri circle, comprises New Thewati, Old Thewati, Letsam, Phokungri and Avangkhu villages. Aid was yet to reach the affected villagers as bridges connecting the area were swept away on August 1, making it physically impossible for relief personnel to make contact with the villagers. The bridges which were washed away include one iron bridge over Khazuti River between Washelo and New Thewati; one wooden bridge between Laruri and Letsam over khazuti River; one wooden bridge over Leyakti River between New Thewati and Letsam; and two more small wooden bridges over smaller streams.According to the ADC, Meluri, the magnitude of damage could not be assessed as five bridges linking the area have been swept away, while telecommunication links remained down. The affected villages comprises of around 200-250 households. The ADC said that the ground situation could be assessed only after rescue personnel reach the area. New Thewati village, which is around 4-5 hours drive from Meluri town, was reported to be the worst affected as it is located in a low-lying area (valley). This village in particular has been cut off from the rest of the state for the past three days. The Phek district administration led by the Deputy Commissioner will attempt to reach the affected area on Monday, the ADC Meluri added. Queried on the possibility of the Phek administration seeking air support from the Army, the ADC said that it will be the prerogative of the State government to make such a call for help to the Army.Meanwhile, sources from the Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority said that rescue personnel have been deployed to the area. The personnel will team up the Home Guards &#038; Civil Defence and the district administration for relief efforts. According to the sources, the Phek district administration was asked to muster all available resources (emergency relief fund) at its disposal for relief efforts.-MExN"

Earlier on July 27, the Nagaland Assembly had adopted a five-point resolution to reiterate their demand. Zeliang said a similar meeting would be held soon with leaders of Naga organisations of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.The tribal bodies argue that â€œthe Nagas are one people and as such, they have every right to live under one administrative umbrellaâ€. Greater Nagaland is one of the most contentious demands of the NSCN-IM, which has been engaged in peace negotiations with the Centre over the past 18 years of their ceasefire. The outfit demands that Nagalandâ€™s boundary be redrawn by slicing off the Naga-inhabited areas of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.But the three neighbouring states are strongly opposed to the design. The Nagas are in a majority in Ukhrul, Tamenglong, Chandel and Senapati districts of Manipur and Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts of Arunachal Pradesh. They also have sizeable populations in Assamâ€™s Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong districts.Greater Nagaland is a very sensitive issue, particularly in Manipur, which will lose more than half of its land if the Centre accedes to the demand. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Manipur during Sangai Festival last year, Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh had made it clear that the state would not part with even an inch of its land. Zeliang said the Nagas were deeply longing for an early solution to the political problem.â€œAn early and honourable solution to the protracted Naga issue is greatly desired by the people for peace and developmentâ€¦ The endorsement of the demand by the tribal bodies will send a good message to the people of Nagaland and the Government of India,â€ he told reporters after Fridayâ€™s meeting.Apart from the NSCN-IM, at least four other armed insurgent groups are active in Nagaland. So, the Centre believes that a settlement with the NSCN-IM may not necessarily be acceptable to the other groups. It is in this perspective that some tribal bodies insist on the unification of the rebel groups before â€œsolutionâ€. One of the groups, NSCN (Khaplang), has gone back to old ways after unilaterally abrogating its 14-year-old ceasefire with the Centre in March.R N Ravi, the Centreâ€™s interlocutor in Naga peace process, will visit Nagaland soon to meet cross sections of the civil society to get the pulse of the people. â€œWe will strive for unity among the various groups. Alongside, the process for solution will continue,â€ Zeliang asserted.-Indian Express"

Five bridges which include one iron bridge, two wooden bridges and two concrete slate bridge were swept away by the flood. The villagers are now virtually trapped between five overflowing rivers namely Khayowti, LÃ¼yakti, Yowthriti and LÃ¼yakti &#038; ZezÃ¼ti rivers between Shilloi and Laruri, the report which was issued by Penthu Pochury, president of Pochury Hoho informed.Further, the lower khel of the vilage, which have been inuntaded by flood, has forced the villagers to move up to the upper khel. The villagers cannot cross to Phokhungri side nor towards Meluri side due to swamp-like deluge in and around their houses as a result of the unexpected flood, the Hoho informed. To add to their misery and helplessness, the Hoho reported that the villagers were also frightened by a â€œsound like that of an aeroplane emerging from below the ground, which at the same time produced a gas which smelt like gun powder.â€The Pochury Hoho has therefore appealed the concern authorities, particularly the disaster management and the district administration to immediately rescue the villagers. Any further delay would jeopardise the lives of villagers, not only of New Thewati but of Old Thewati, it feared. It also appealed the neighbouring villages to render their valuable services in reconstructing the damaged/destroyed bridges at the earliest.Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Phek when contacted said the district administration was taking stock of the situation. He also confirmed of the incident where a youth of New Thewati was swept away by the flood, adding that the victim was yet to be traced due to the strong current of the river flood.On the reports of sounds emerging from â€˜below the groundâ€™ as reported by villagers to Pochury Hoho, the DC believed that it may be the rumbling sounds of stones and boulders being swept away by the river flood.

In May, all eight Congress MLAs â€“ SI Jamir, Tokheho Yepthomi, Apok Jamir, Hukavi Zhimomi, Imtiwapang, Imtikumzuk Longkomer, Ishak Konyak and Khekaho â€“ joined the Nagaland People`s Front (NPF)-led DAN government throwing the political landscape into a state of flux.SI Jamir and Apok Jamir also happen to be the brother and son respectively of former Congress chief minister and current Governor of Odisha, SC Jamir. While Tokheho Yepthomi was made minister for public health and engineering, SI Jamir holds Cabinet rank as advisor to chief minister and Imti Kumzuk Longkumar was made deputy speaker of the Assembly. The other five MLAs were made parliamentary secretaries.The sequence of events unfolded from February this year when then Nagaland Pradesh Congress Committee (NPCC) president SI Jamir and then Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Tokheho Yepthomi briefed party president Sonia Gandhi that they would like to join the government of Chief Minister TR Zeliang. â€œThe party president said that she had no problem in them joining the DAN government provided the BJP was not a part of it,â€ explained Narayanasamy.The two state leaders then informed Zeliang that the Congress high command has approved of them joining his government provided the BJP was not a part of it. In April, a â€œpolitical affairs committeeâ€ of the party`s state unit passed a resolution approving the MLAs` bid to join the government. But party members raised objections saying that such a resolution can only be passed by the executive committee and not by any political affairs committee. â€œYou see, the resolution was not unanimous and the party was split on the issue,â€ Narayanasamy said.On May 5, Gandhi appointed K Therie as the NPCC president and the very next day the latter issued a directive to the MLAs not to join the DAN government.According to Narayanasamy, on May 7, a press statement was also issued saying that the MLAs have been directed by the Congress president not to join the DAN government â€œas we cannot be on the same side as that of a communal party like BJPâ€. The very next day, the eight MLAs were inducted into the government. â€œI, as party general secretary, immediately suspended them and issued a show-cause notice,â€ Narayanasamy said.So what was their response? â€œThey said that to solve the Naga political issue, the chief minister has proposed an all-party government and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given an assurance (in December last year) that the Naga issue would be solved within 18 months. They also said that in case the party leaders felt that they have violated the party directive, they were sorry,â€ the Congress general secretary said.Narayanasamy then sent a rejoinder saying that the MLAs` act of joining the government was not acceptable and â€œas a matter of principle, the Congress and the BJP cannot sit in the same governmentâ€. â€œWe also said that though you are suspended from the party, you are still Congressmen and you have to oppose the government on the floor of the house,â€ he said.The party also issued a three-line whip on this basis to the eight MLAs a week before the ongoing Budget Session of the Assembly that started on July 21. However, there has been no reply to the latest whip. â€œWe are now consulting legal experts on whether to move the speaker and disqualify them from the Assembly or to expel them from the party,â€ Narayanasamy said. â€œWe will take a decision within a very short period.â€-IANS"

It affects the spring in her jump,&#8221; Nandi said. &#8220;That was the hardest part to fix for Dipa, we had to work very, very hard when she was a little kid to get the curve in her feet.&#8221; &#8220;Only after coach Nandi corrected my flat foot, my journey began,&#8221; adds Dipa saying she would be nothing today if not for her coach. But since then, the desire to work hard has not diminished for the Agartala girl.&#8220;I was so young when I tried gymnastics for the first time. My father was a SAI coach and he wanted me to try it, so I just went along with him. I wasn&#8217;t really that interested in the beginning,&#8221; Dipa said. &#8220;But in 2007 when I won at the Junior Nationals in Jalpaiguri I started gaining interest.&#8221; Then came the turning-point for Dipa. She was part of the 2010 Indian gymnastics contingent in the Delhi Commonwealth Games where, as a participant, she saw Ashish Kumar create history by winning India&#8217;s first ever gymnastic medals at the games. &#8220;That&#8217;s when I told myself I will win it for India in Glasgow four years down the line,&#8221; said Dipa.And so she did it in Glasgow &#8211; the same place where she is headed soon for the World Championships that begin in October and is a qualifying event for Rio 2016. &#8220;I am working hard for the Worlds now. That is all my focus in on now It is a very tough event &#8211; all the top players will be there. Last time I finished 10th but now I am practising harder with increased difficulty levels. I am hoping to put my best effort and see if I can make it to the Olympics,&#8221; she said.As she prepares for the World Championships, Dipa trains from 9 am &#8211; 12: 30 pm and 5 &#8211; 8:30 pm every day &#8211; hoping to improve on her performance in Hiroshima. The event from where the gymnasts who finish on the podium qualify directly for the Olympics is her toughest challenge yet. As she turns 22 on 9 August, she is growing &#8216;old&#8217; by the standards seen in Gymnastics these days. The Gold and Silver medallists in the Hiroshima event were both 15-year-olds. But she doesn&#8217;t see that as an issue.&#8220;I still feel at the top of my game. There was an Olympian in 2012 who competed with the best when he was 39 years old! I still feel I have 5-6 years left in my game, no problem,&#8221; she says with confidence. It&#8217;s because there is still a place for power gymnastics in international events, explains Nandi. &#8220;Desire, hunger to do well in gymnastics. Dipa has that. She told me once &#8216;Whatever you want me to do, I will not say no to you coach&#8217;,&#8221; and except when she loses her temper with me, she has kept her word,&#8221; Nandi laughed.&#8220;Yes, I am a bit short-tempered,&#8221; Dipa agreed with a sheepish grin. &#8220;I get angry a lot &#8211; some times at the coach when something he tells doesn&#8217;t work but most times at myself for not doing the routine correctly. (I) Never get angry at my parents but when I am trying my coach is my father and mother, and we have gotten used to it,&#8221; she adds.Like with many other not-so-popular sports in India, 58-year-old Nandi said that gymnastics still has a long way to go before there are more like Ashish and Dipa. &#8220;Starting late last year, we had no facilities to practice at all for eight full months, because of problems with the federation. All we did was personal training, but without equipment Dipa lost eight months of training time,&#8221; said Nandi.&#8220;But thankfully, SAI (Sports Authority of India) organised a camp for two months starting June. I can honestly say without that camp Dipa would not have won Bronze in Hiroshima. Despite problems, we are grateful for what help we get from authorities,&#8221; he said. Dipa, who says she has been training at the vault table harder than ever, concurred that things have been different since she won the medal at Glasgow.&#8220;Things have changed now. Before Glasgow, Indians hardly knew our women participated in gymnastics. Now they know there is someone who won a medal. Before, no one knew my name. Today, slowly and steadily, more and more people know there is someone called Dipa Karmakar,&#8221; she said before excusing herself for her second training session of the day.-Firstpost"

With the help of the semi-conductor industry, including computer manufacturing, design and packing, Taiwan has been able to distinguish itself from its competitors,&#8221; he added.Writer and researcher Subir Bhowmik said: &#8220;If a small island nation like Taiwan can place its footprint in many parts of the world with its products, the north-eastern states, including Tripura, could achieve a similar success utilising their vast resources and connectivity with adjoining countries.&#8220;Bhowmik&#8217;s views were echoed by Tripura governor Tathagata Roy, a renowned civil engineer and former professor of Jadavpur University in Kolkata. &#8220;Tripura and other north-eastern states have a tremendous scope to boost its economy, exploit its resources and attract investment, capitalising the proximity with neighbouring countries specially Bangladesh,&#8221; Roy added.&#8220;If a small nation like Taiwan can take up the challenge of developing itself, why not Tripura and other north-eastern states,&#8221; the governor asked. Chief technology officer of Bangalore-based Hinduja Global Solutions C. Subramanya said: &#8220;Tripura and other north-eastern states have resources and potentialities, but there must be a serious marketing about their scopes and prospects across the country and abroad to turn the mission into reality.&#8221;Bank of America vice-president (IT) Saumen Sarkar said, it is a historic opportunity to boost the economy of Tripura, with the setting up of the third International Internet Gateway (IIG) in Agartala. The state would now be the information technology hub in north-east India and also play a vital role in eastern India as far as internet connectivity is concerned. The commissioning of the country&#8217;s third IIG here, after Chennai and Mumbai, will happen within the next few months.&#8220;If major IT companies utilise the scope of Agartala IIG, the proposed capacity of 10 gigabit bandwidth could be increased to 40 gigabit, ensuring the growth of IT and other industries in the north-easten region,&#8221; said Sarkar, who also runs a northeast-centric news portal. He said that it is a golden opportunity for the IT Industry and the economic roadmap of Tripura as the Indo-Bangladesh surplus undersea internet bandwidth lease agreement was signed during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s visit to Dhaka during June 6-7 in the presence of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Under the agreement, Bangladesh would provide surplus internet bandwidth to north-east India and to extend the facility, the submarine internet cable from Bangladesh&#8217;s Cox&#8217;s Bazar coastal town to Tripura&#8217;s capital Agartala is being laid. Tripura&#8217;s industry and commerce secretary M. Nagaraju said: &#8220;India and Bangladesh has been trying hard to restore the pre-1947 connectivities through rail, road, air and water. If the connectivities between the north-eastern states and Bangladesh develop, it would be a great boom to the economy of both sides.&#8220;With unexpected growth of natural rubber production, bamboo-based industries and Tripura&#8217;s locational advantage, the state has marked its place in the country,&#8221; the IAS officer said. Tripura chief secretary Yashpal Singh said that with the proposed plan to connect Tripura with the Bangladesh railway network and to construct a bridge over river Feni to get access the Chittagong international seaport, Tripura would be the gateway of the South-East Asian countries in the near future. Transportation via Bangladesh is much easier as road connectivity is a big factor for the mountainous north-eastern states which share boundaries with Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan and China.A narrow land corridor is used by the rest of India to travel to the northeastern region, through Assam and West Bengal, but this route passes through hilly terrain with steep gradients and multiple hairpin bends, making plying of vehicles, especially loaded trucks, very difficult. Agartala via Guwahati is 1,650 km from Kolkata by road and 2,637 km from New Delhi, while the distance between Agartala and Kolkata via Bangladesh is just about 620 km.-oneindia"

There may be confusion among the public that life imprisonment means 14 years in jail, but life imprisonment is now life in prison.â€â€œIt is not an experiment where the culprit comes out of jail and we see if the person has been reformed. Rather, life imprisonment will send a message to society that the penalty for murder is living inside jail for the rest of your life,â€ he said."

Now we will get high speed internet, which is ideal for IT industry,â€ said Saumen Sarkar, vice president of the Bank of America (IT). Sarkar, who hails from Tripura, is organising a conclave in Agartala on Thursday to explore possibilities of the IT industry in the state. Several top IT honchos from Indian companies and foreign diplomats will attend the one-day conclave.â€œThis is a new opportunity for not only Tripura but the whole of Indiaâ€™s northeast,â€ said Sarkar. He said the region has a vast pool of skilled English-educated IT manpower â€” thousands of men and women who work in the IT industry of cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad.â€œIf Indian majors open shop in Tripura, these men and women can be brought back easily to run the show,â€ Sarkar said. He said Tripura can also be the â€œbackyardâ€ of the fledgling IT industry of Bangladesh. Bangladesh is planning to double its IT exports by 2017 .â€œThey can develop parellel centres in Tripura for their market because it will work out cheaper and more efficient,â€ he said."

This significant step will encourage other militant outfits of the region to initiate peace talks with the government,&#8221; Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra (INPT) president Bijoy Kumar Hrangkhawl said.At the instance of then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, Hrangkhawl&#8217;s dreaded militant outfit Tripura National Volunteers (TNV) had signed a tripartite peace accord with the central and Tripura governments on August 12, 1988 before around 450 men of the outfit surrendered. Subsequently, the TNV merged with a tribal based political party Tripura Upajati Juba Samity and formed the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura (INPT) in 2002.The 70-year-old tribal leader has served as a member of the Tripura assembly for 10 years from 1998. Speaking on the accord with the NSCN-IM, Hrangkhawl said: &#8220;It is good for both the northeast region and the Nagas, as the NSCN-IM had been fighting for the cause of the Nagas for many decades.&#8221; The central government and the NSCN-IM held more than 50 rounds of peace talks to end one of south Asia&#8217;s longest-running insurgencies in which 25,000 people have died since 1947.Meanwhile, according to an official of the union home ministry, around seven extremist outfits of the northeast region, including United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA-Pro-Talk faction) and National Democratic Front of Bodoland-Progressive (NDFB-P), are currently under ceasefire and suspension of operation agreement with the government.Officials of Tripura and union home ministry had held two-round of talks with the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) after the rebel group expressed their willingness to hold peace talks. Members of NLFT and All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF) have taken shelter and arms training in Bangladesh, which shares a 856-km border with Tripura.Both outfits, banned in 1997, advocate secession of Tripura from India. But as most ATTF cadres have surrendered, the group is almost non-existent now. In view of the significant taming of terrorism in Tripura, the Left-ruled state government on May 27 withdrew the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) which gives sweeping powers and judicial immunity to security forces in conflict-hit areas. The law was enforced in the state 18 years ago to curb terrorism.-IANS"

 Anshu Jamsenpa an Everester from Bomdila, Arunachal Pradesh, the only Indian woman to have scaled the Mt. Everest thrice and the only mother in the world to have done so twice in 10 days. Whew!Dream. Dare. Win. You have to first dream, and then dare to fulfill that dream and finally you win. The mind is very powerful. You can achieve what your mind perceives. But it is very important to know your weaknesses and strengths. Positive attitude gives you the strength to fight against all odds.I am a mountaineer from Bomdilla, a small town in Arunachal Pradesh along the Indo-Chinese border. Have you heard of my hometown? There are just 25,000 people there and it is a beautiful place. I am 35 years old and a proud mother of two daughters aged 13 and 9.As a child I was always interested in adventure activity and was passionate about it. But the opportunity came by in 2009 when Wange my husband, organized National Himalayan Trekking Programme which had rock climbing as one of the events . One afternoon, I prepared lunch for some of the mountaineer friends and went over. It was a god sent opportunity for me! The group of rock climbers did a recce on the rock face and they were taking time to decide. Impulsively I went up to them and said I wanted to try. They were pleasantly surprised and happy to take me in. I finished rapping down the rock face successfully. I joined the last group of trekking. They said, â€œyou are courageousâ€ and that is how my journey as a mountaineer began. I learnt itâ€™s a huge subject. I took up a fifteen-day course after which I wanted to do a basic course. The instructors were impressed and told me that I could climb the Everest. I spoke to Wange about it and we decided that after completing the advanced course I would go for it.The decision to scale Everest was taking me a step closer to my goal of helping out people, as mountaineering had social and economic benefits to offer. Since my childhood I wanted to do something different. I guess that was a strong inspiration to try and go to the top.After the initial euphoria settled down, I realized that being a mountaineer has its own difficulties. Mountaineering is expensive and one of the most risky adventure sport. Arranging finances for my expedition was the biggest challenge.
 During my initial stage I faced a lotof discouragement. But later on after I had my achievements and mountaineering records to show, things changed. Apart from that, emotional, mental and physical hardships also had to be dealt with. I knew it is never going to be easy to be as a mother to even make an attempt but I also knew that if I attempt I wonâ€™t look back. I think itâ€™s about conviction and self â€“belief.In 2015 on the 7thof April the expedition for Mt.Everest was flagged off in Itanagar. With great enthusiasm and determination, I started my journey. Through my past experiences I have come to realize that no matter how well prepared you are, its helplessness that one faces when it comes to the forces of nature.
 On 25th of April the earthquake that shook Nepal, took its toll in the form of numerous avalanches on Mt. Everest. It is the worst thing that can happen during a mountain expedition. I was lucky to have survived the fury of nature but others werenâ€™t so lucky. Our camp side at Everest base camp was totally destroyed by the avalanche. Along with other mountaineers and sherpas, we cleared the debris, helped the injured and collected whatever was left of the expedition, with a sense of desolation. It was a sad situation at the base camp with many dead and injured mountaineers spread all over.This has not been the first time that an expedition has been called off and it is not an easy situation to deal with. You see your goal ahead, charged up with all the energy, and then it suddenly disappears. It is like dreaming a beautiful dream and just before you reach where you were headed, someone shakes you up. It is very upsetting but I am keeping myself motivated and hoping that my dream will be fulfilled someday soon.I would like to tell the youth of our country that they should be passionate about everything they do in life. Believe in yourself.This year I got associated with Reachout Foundation and I support the cause you are working for. I feel if you really want the country to develop then there cannot be any discrimination. I am always ready to do whatever I can to fight prejudice and discrimination. Yes, we can !-Our Stories.org.in"

In 2012, the figure was 66,302.&#8220;Some of the factors responsible for poor tourist inflow to the destination are lack of connectivity, non-availability of reasonably priced hotel accommodation, absence of tourism infrastructure and carrying capacity of the destination.&#8221; He said the government has included the northeast in two new tourism schemes that have been launched. Apart from the Northeast Circuit under the &#8216;Swadesh Darshan&#8217; scheme, two other circuits under the scheme &#8211; Buddhist Circuit and Himalayan Circuit &#8211; can be linked to the regionAccording to the minister, Kamakhya in Guwahati has been identified under the Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (Prasad) scheme. Sharma said as against the required 10 percent budgetary allocation of every central government ministry for the development of the northeastern region, the tourism ministry has been providing more than that in the last three fiscal years.In 2014-15, the ministry allocated Rs.144.68 crore (Rs.1.44 billion) from its Rs.1,100-crore budget in 2014-15 or 13.15 percent of the total budget. In 2013-14, it was Rs.149.16 crore out of Rs.980 crore and in 2012-13, it was Rs.113.72 crore out of Rs.950 crore. This apart, the ministry has undertaken several initiatives for the promotion of tourism in the northeast, Sharma said.These include provision of complimentary space to the northeast in India pavilions set up at major international travel fairs and exhibitions and 100 percent central government financial assistance for organising fairs and festivals in the northeastern states.&#8220;The ministry of tourism, as part of its ongoing activities, annually releases print, electronic, online and outdoor media campaigns in the international and domestic markets, under the Incredible India brand line, to promote various tourism destinations and products of the country, including the lesser known destinations which have tourism potential,&#8221; the minister said. &#8220;The ministry of tourism undertakes special campaigns on northeastern region on TV channels to promote tourism in the region.&#8221;He said the International Tourism Mart (ITM) is organised annually with the objective of showcasing the largely untapped tourism potential of the northeastern region in the domestic and international markets. &#8220;In addition, a series of promotional activities are undertaken in important and potential tourist generating markets overseas through the India Tourism Offices abroad with the objective of showcasing India&#8217;s tourism potential.&#8221;Under the &#8216;Swadesh Darshan&#8217; scheme, an amount of Rs.20.35 crore has been allocated to the state government of Manipur in 2013-14 fiscal for the &#8220;Integrated Cable-Car and Lakeside Tourism Development Project at Loktak Lake&#8221;. &#8220;Under this scheme, funds are allocated under public-private partnership,&#8221; Sharma said.In reply to another question, the minister said the North Eastern Council had conducted a study for the identification of tourism circuits in the northeast and the same has been shared with the respective state governments.

Although there is no easy approach to achieve such goals which need time and efforts, more than a decade has lapsed since the northeast was given a special place in the â€˜Look Eastâ€™ policy, but there seems to be lack of political will to implement the same, says the book â€œIndiaâ€™s Look East Policy And The Northeastâ€.Published by Sage, the book is written by Thongkholal Haokip, Assistant Professor of political science at Presidency University, Kolkata. The northeastern states had been exposed to international trade during the pre-colonial and colonial period. It had negligible impact on the local economy as tea plantation was developed into enclave production without having any linkage with the hinterland.In the post-independence period, the exploitative nature of the British colonial rule continued in the region with just a change in the stakeholders from British to Indian capitalists, the book says. The main component of the â€˜Look Eastâ€™ policy is to bring development in the northeastern region through the expansion of regional trade linkage with the economies of its eastern neighbours.Indiaâ€™s northeast has more geographical proximity and contact with other countries than the Indian mainland. It is connected to mainland by a mere 21-km-long landmass called â€˜Siliguri corridorâ€™ which is less than two per cent of the 5000 km combined perimeter formed by the seven northeastern states,  while the remaining borders China, Myanmar, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal.The Partition of India in 1947 caused this extreme geo-political isolation of the northeast, making it the most regulated, a sensitive border region and the most exposed territory. Partition also caused severance of the inland water, road and railway communication through the erstwhile East Pakistan and access to the Chittagong port was lost. The Chinese takeover of Tibet and the virtual closure of border with Myanmar added to the isolation of the region, the author says.The â€˜Look Eastâ€™ policy rightly aims at the creation of an enabling environment so as to end the landlocked situation and isolation of the northeastern region by opening up the borders and reintegrating the regionâ€™s economy through improved trade and connectivity between northeast India and Southeast Asian countries. However, when we consider the existing ground realities, the growth of border trade between the northeastern region and neighbouring countries is slow.Except the opening of border trade between India and Myanmar at Moreh and Champhai, and between India and China at Nathula, and the much hyped 165-km-long Indo-Myanmar friendship Road connecting Tamu and Kalaymyo Kalewa in 2001, nothing significant has happened on ground. The â€˜Look Eastâ€™ policy, therefore needs a reorientation to suit the development interests of the northeastern region, the book says.Despite the enormous potential of the â€˜Look Eastâ€™ policy, Indiaâ€™s border trade with the countries neighbouring the northeastern region is declining. This may insulate the age-old ties existing between ethnic kin living in the border despite the separation between two different nations and further alienate them, it says.-PTI"

That it has happened under the leadership of Narendra Modi, with RN Ravi as the Centre&#8217;s interlocutor, and national security advisor Ajit Doval as the less-than-hidden hand, is to the credit of the current dispensation. Nevertheless, it is useful to recognise that this is, at best, the last step in a journey in which several successive regimes had already covered many miles. Crucially, moreover, it is far from a conclusive resolution of the &#8220;Naga problem&#8221;. While this deal is certainly historic in its significance, it is not the end of troubles in Nagaland. There are still several armed factions that will need to be accommodated before the Nagaland problem can be said to have been resolved, and at least some of these will be tempted to escalate violence in the immediate future, partially to increase their leverage in future negotiations, and partly to occupy the militant space purportedly vacated by the NSCN-IM, as a result of its accord with the government.The Congress&#8217; rather strident criticism of the accord has been both churlish and mischievous, and does not need to be taken seriously. Indeed, it is useful to reiterate that the present agreement would necessarily reflect a continuity of efforts and underlying principles established under previous regimes. Moreover, the NPA government did not &#8220;take the states into confidence&#8221; any more than the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has, and that is the nature of such negotiations. That this is &#8220;insulting to the states and people of the Northeast&#8221;, as Sonia Gandhi provocatively suggests, is nonsense. While the details of the deal will inevitably be shared, clearly, it cannot contain elements that would compromise the interests and territorial integrity of the neighbouring states, unless the principal state interlocutors and everyone in the central government have completely lost their minds. The NPA&#8217;s problem was &#8220;sour grapes&#8221;, because it wasn&#8217;t able to push the deal to a conclusion during its tenure &#8211; though they were many occasions when a settlement was believed to be tantalisingly within reach.The accord is expected to contain the basic provisions that have crystallised over the years, specifically, that the immediate deal will relate only to the territory of Nagaland, and that other territorial claims like that of &#8220;Greater Nagalim&#8221; will be resolved consensually through dialogue with neighbouring states. It is likely that the deal will pave the way to an election where the NSCN-IM or a successor political party will be facilitated to secure power through polls.There will now have to be a renewed focus on what the other Naga factions are likely to do. This deal will overwhelmingly favour NSCN(IM), and, at the same time, vacate a vast dissenting space which other groups &#8211; most significantly NSCN-K, but also the lesser formations, such as NSCN (Khole-Kitovi), NSCN-Reformation, NSCN-Reunification, Naga National Council (NNC), Zeliangrong Revolutionary Army, among others &#8211; will attempt to occupy. Further, the possibilities of a split within NSCN(IM) cannot be ruled out. It was, itself, born out of a peace deal: the Shillong Accord that the government had with the NNC in 1975, which some elements refused to accept, and came to create the then unified NSCN. When the loaves and cakes have been distributed, there will be many who feel they have lost out; it remains to be seen what they would do. The deal with the NSCN(IM) is also of critical importance for the insurgencies across the Northeast, because the group had become an opportunistic facilitator for a number of other insurgent formations in the region, and all these will suffer as a consequence of the loss of underground support from the NSCN(IM) faction. This may, however, mean that NSCN-Khaplang will gain in influence. Nevertheless, the much larger infrastructure and capacities of the NSCN(IM) group would now, hopefully, be lost to the other surviving insurgencies in the region as well.Crucially, the present agreement is likely to be no more than a basic &#8220;framework&#8221; agreement, spelling out the principles of concrete settlement. Vexing issues, among others, of dismantling the NSCN(IM) camps, of demobilising and disarming its armed cadre, of dismantling the parallel security, administration and taxation networks long operated by the NSCN(IM), will remain to be hammered out, and will not be easy to address, particularly since NSCN(IM) cadres are likely to plead that unless all other groups are disarmed they will need to retain their capacities to defend themselves. Such a position, however, would lead to a perpetuation of an unacceptable status quo on the ground.-dailyo.in"

 Lily TeksengWhile coming to power, the BJP-led NDA government made lots of promises. Now itâ€™s the time to pay back. After one year of Modi sarkar, Northeast Today looks at what has the central government truly done for the Northeast region.After assuming the Prime Ministerâ€™s office, Narendra Modi made it clear that he meant business for the Northeast. After many years, perhaps for the first time, the PM visited Northeast in such a frequency. In November 2014, Modi inaugurated a power plant in Tripura, the Hornbill and Sangai Festival in Nagaland and Manipur respectively. The first rail line in history to connect Meghalaya to the Indian Railways map also saw the presence of the Prime Minister. Soon after, he was back in Arunachal Pradesh in February to celebrate the 29th Arunachal Statehood Day, and even this visit saw him flagging off the first train from Arunachal to Delhi.During the LS polls campaign, the region saw him extensively as the Prime Ministerial candidate. It was unprecedented to have PM visit, with such rigour, a region that still escapes the national imagination. Through his â€˜Make in Indiaâ€™ campaign, it seems that PM Modi understands the importance of Northeast in the global arena. A hotspot of resources and the gateway to Southeast Asia, the region has all the potential to be the power house of the nation in terms of its development and growth. The Look East Policy, features prominently in this governmentâ€™s agendas which engenders the Act East policy aimed at bringing infrastructural development to facilitate the connecting of the ASEAN economies to India.In this grand scheme of things, one year seems as a small pint of time to make conclusions. However, the ambitious transnational infrastructure projects as envisioned in this policy means far-reaching changes of the region. The recent visit of PM Modi to Bangladesh also saw many strategic tie-ups for the region. In terms of connectivity two bus services were flagged off linking West Bengal to three Northeastern states via Dhaka. Soon after, the Minister of Road Transport and Highways signed the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal Motor Vehicle Agreement (BBIN-MVA) in Bhutan, aimed at boosting trade and sub-regional connectivity among the four nations. Similarly, Bangladesh, China, India, and Myanmar (BCIM pact) is aimed at linking Kunming province in China to Kolkata in India. Apart from this, many projects have been earmarked for the region. National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation recently awarded 18 projects worth 800 crore, which includes about 600 km of roads in the states of Tripura, Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.Northeast Today caught up with the Union Minister of Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju and the DoNER Minister Jitendra Singh to ascertain the achievements so far and the future plans ahead for the region.NET: Would you please comment on PM Modiâ€™s special interest in the development and vision for the Northeast?
 Kiren Rijiju: First of all itâ€™s the confidence building measures. The PM has made it clear that Northeast will be his focus area. He has ensured that all ministers are engaged â€“ every 15 days and four or five ministers have to visit Northeast, understand ground realities, then come back and make policy as per the need of the region. Huge budgetary allocations have been made for infrastructure like railways, roads, telecom, etc. For telecom alone, more than 9,000 crore was allocated in Arunachal Pradesh and Karbi Anglong belt. In terms of power, Arunachal and Sikkim are clubbed together in a project of about nine to 10,000 crore. Likewise, we are going to fund lots of project in the border areas. Earlier the Border Area Development Programme (BADP) share was 27 per cent, but, now it is being raised to 40 per cent. I am overseeing most of these projects myself.
 So, I am very hopeful that in the next three to four years there will be massive changes on the ground.NET: Are you happy about your governmentâ€™s performance in the last one year?
 Kiren Rijiju: Yes, all major changes have taken place in the last one year. For states like Arunachal, we are even relaxing the population criteria to build roads, so even with lesser population, the PMGSY will qualify for Northeast. Likewise, we are going to have much more favourable policies for the region.NET: Do you think the recent spurts of violence will hamper the process of development for the region?
 Kiren Rijiju: No, why will it hamper? If militants are creating trouble then it is the job of the security personnel to react and secure peace. So while doing that, they need to launch operations and take strong actions. My only worry is that while taking actions against the militants, there should be no abuse of human rights and local people should not suffer. But at the same time, Iâ€™d like to appeal to the local people to cooperate with the security forces because when drastic actions are taken, there are consequent hardships and inconveniences. These inconveniences must be absorbed. Local people must support the security forces so that we can secure long-term peace along the area.NET: How do you assess the performance of DoNER ministry during the past one year?
 Jitendra Singh: Ever since the present government took over, Northeast has been very high on the priority list. The added feature is that the PM himself takes personal interest in the regionâ€™s development. When I was given responsibility of the DoNER ministry we have tried to adopt a futuristic approach, with primary focus on the development of the region. Besides the physical development, one important aspect that we need to address is to bridge the psychological gap between Northeast and the rest of India.The DoNER ministry will be locating its offices by rotation every month in one of the eight states. We started off in January-February from Manipur, then Tripura, and so on. This will give a message to the people that for each and every grievance, they need not have to travel to New Delhi. New Delhi can also travel to them.
 For the students of Northeast living in other parts of the country, we have started contemplating a number of plans. We are coming up with hostels in South Delhi campus and other campuses in JNU. On the business front, I personally initiated the first meetings with ministers from eastern countries. We had invited ministers from Myanmar, Bhutan, and Bangladesh because so much commonality exists as far as our eating and cultural habits are concerned, that our produce can be marketed on both sides.NET: What are the plans in your pipeline for development of infrastructure in the region.
 Jitendra Singh: There are many ambitious plans in the pipeline. We have flagged off the idea to have a Northeast Road Corporation â€“ the feasibility of which has to worked upon. But, we have already started the work on the expansion of roads wherever required.NET: The recent Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) was met with satisfaction but some tribes in Meghalaya are unhappy about being left out of the process of decision making.
 Jitendra Singh: As far as the LBA is concerned, you must give all credit to PM Modiâ€™s leadership because this was something that has been stuck for so many years. We are already 40 years late in accomplishing this. This should have happened at least around the time when Bangladesh was born.
 So I think by all reasoning this is the commendable way forward. Overall, this will be for the larger interest of the region.NET: Recently Tripura CM Manik Sarkar met PM Modi requesting him not to cancel the special status of the Northeastern states. Is there any cause for concern?
 Jitendra Singh: No, there is nothing of concern. Yes, the meeting was held but I would refrain from commenting on this part because the government takes overall view on such issues. My main aim is development. I think this is one of the best times for Northeast. The PM himself is following up the development of Northeast. But now, it is our responsibility to get the maximum benefit and the most optimum development. So, I think all of us have a stake."

 &#8220;If a single inch of territorial area of Manipur is taken, we will fight tooth and nail,&#8221; Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh told reporters targeting the Narendra Modi dispensation.A &#8216;greater Nagalim&#8217; or integration of Naga-inhabited has been the main demand of NSCN-IM, with whom the Centre signed the agreement on August 3 aiming to end the decades-long insurgency in the northeastern state. It is, however, unclear whether the &#8216;greater Nagalim&#8217; demand has been accepted.Details and execution plan within the framework agreement are yet to be released.
 Nagaland&#8217;s neighbours Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh are opposed to integration of Naga-inhabited areas.
 Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi accused Modi of &#8220;blatantly violating&#8221; the spirit of cooperative federalism and parliamentary democracy by not consulting him and his Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur counterparts over such an important matter.&#8220;I doubt whether the Chief Minister of Nagaland has been consulted,&#8221; he said while Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki was of the view that the accord has come as a &#8220;surprise&#8221; as the Prime Minister &#8220;forgot&#8221; to contact the Congress chief ministers concerned.Tuki said that he welcomed the peace process, but this should be done &#8220;without compromising territorial integrity&#8221; while Gogoi wondered as to why the accord has been kept secret, &#8220;if it affects &#8230;states, we will oppose tooth and nail&#8221;.Congress chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala targeted the Modi government for &#8220;keeping the three elected state governments in complete dark&#8221; with no involvement either in the process of negotiations or finalisation of terms of peace agreement.Addressing a joint press conference at the Congress headquarters along with the three chief ministers and Congress general secretaries V Narainsamy and C P Joshi, he also hit out at Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman accusing her of deliberately misleading the nation on the issue.Meanwhile, Government on Friday sought to allay fears of neighbouring states of Nagaland by assuring them that they would be consulted before the final agreement with NSCN-IM was signed.This was conveyed by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh to Nagaland Chief Minister T R Zeliang who called on him here today. Sources said the Home Minister explained to the Chief Minister that a framework has been laid in the Monday&#8217;s agreement and the final pact will be signed only after detailed discussions in coming months.

But if the peace in Nagaland is at the cost of our territories than we wonâ€™t let it happen,â€ Ninon Ering, Member of Parliament from East Arunachal Pradesh said. He said It should be understood that Nagas staying in any other state apart from Nagaland â€œare an integral part of that state as they have been staying there for years. Where does the demand for other states to give up its Naga-inhabited areas come from?â€ he asked.Noting that there were only four Naga tribes living in Arunachal Pradesh, including the Wancho, Tangsa and Nocte, Ering said: â€œAt most the government can allow them to have autonomous councils, but giving up those areas to Nagaland wonâ€™t be possible.â€ IANS spoke to a number of MPs from the region.On Monday, the NSCN-IM and the government had signed the Naga Peace Accord, settling an almost 20-year-old peace negotiation process that started in 1997 after the group signed a ceasefire agreement. NSCN-IM general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah, who signed the accord oat a ceremony at the prime ministerâ€™s 7 Race Course Road residence on Monday, had hailed it as a â€œmomentous occasionâ€.Thokchom Meinya, Member of Parliament from Inner Manipur constituency, said that the BJP-led government and the NSCN-IM were in â€œa hurry to settle their problems without realising the harm causedâ€ to other north-eastern states.â€œThe way government is trying to keep the content of the accord confidential clearly shows that it might have something which is not in favour of Nagalandâ€™s neighbouring states,â€ Meinya said. He added that the government should have at least informed Parliament before signing the accord with the NSCN-IM. â€œDiscussing in Parliament with all stake-holders was necessary,â€ he added.Nagaland shares its boundary with Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. At least three districts in Manipur &#8211; Ukhrul, Tamenglong and Senapati as well as two in Arunachal Pradesh &#8211; Tirap and Changlang &#8211; are Naga-inhabited districts. PA Sangma, Member of Parliament from Meghalayaâ€™s Tura constituency, said: â€œEnd to the conflict in the North-Eastern region is a must. But the government should be well aware that they canâ€™t keep Nagaland happy by making its neighbouring states sad.â€However, Nagalandâ€™s lone Rajya Sabha member Khekiho Zhimomi termed the objection raised by the other MPs from the region â€œgroundlessâ€ and said that â€œall the Naga inhabited areas in the North-Eastern region belonged to the Naga ancestorsâ€ and should be made a part of the Nagaland. â€œIt is a positive development for Nagaland. The peace accord should be completely in the interest of the Nagas regardless of whichever North-Eastern states they might be living in,â€ Zhimomi said.â€œWhy should they object to the Naga inhabited land being given to form Greater Nagaland? We are only demanding our ancestoral lands in the neighbouring states where the Naga tribes have been staying for centuries,â€ said Zhimomi.On Tuesday, former Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio had told IANS: â€œThe demand for Greater Nagaland is the main demand of the NSCN &#8211; irrespective of which faction it is. The question of dropping that demand does not arise as this is what the conflict is all about.â€-IANS"

 NET Bureau, Dhiraj Kumar SarmaOn June 4, Indian army suffered one of the biggest casualties in an ambush led by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) at Moltung in Chandel district of Manipur. After the massacre, insurgency of Northeast once again grabbed the limelight. Northeast Today brings to you the past and present state of some major outfits as well as analysis on various aspects of NE insurgency.Separatist movements have affected at least four Northeastern states â€“ Assam, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland in the past. And the fact that there are still over 50 active insurgent groups across the Northeast is a grim reminder of the ground reality. The problem escalated when some Myanmarbased NE militant outfits formed a joint forum called United National Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFWSEA), which will soon form a Northeast â€œgovernmentin- exileâ€.In 1966, B George Verghese, the veteran journalist and intellectual, counted six active insurgencies in the Northeast: Naga in Nagaland, Manipur and adjacent areas; Meitei in the Imphal Valley of Manipur; Assamese and Bodo in Assam; Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council in Khasi Hills of Meghalaya; and the indigenous peopleâ€™s revolt of Tripura. Sundry other insurgent groups or splinter organisations, he said, are at large while others have surrendered or became dormant.NET: You have met both Khaplang and Paresh Baruah in person. What according to you are their strengths?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : Their strength is the terrain and also the unity that they have achieved among themselves. The unity has always been there, but now, four groups have come together under a joint forum called UNLFW and some Manipuri groups have also offered their moral support. The six Manipuri groups, who have camps in the region, formed an alliance called Coordination Committee (CorCom). Although they have not signed the declaration so far that was issued sometime back, they have offered moral support to UNLFW. As per the latest information available, at least three among the Manipuri groups agreed to take part in joint operations, which was apparent in the recent attack in which Manipuri groups KYKL and a KCP faction were involved. Their strength is also on account of the fact that there are arteries connecting the Hukawng valley or the region directly to China which ensures an unhindered and uninterrupted flow of sophisticated weapons and ammunitions. Another advantage is that Khaplang has a cosy relationship with the Myanmarese Army. The NSCN-K had signed a ceasefire agreement with the Myanmarese Army on April 9, 2012. Both sides have agreed to accept each other without any pre-conditions. Myanmarese Army in all likelihood will not disturb Khaplang or accept New Delhiâ€™s request to eliminate them.NET: With reports of â€˜government-in-exileâ€™ looming large in Myanmar, whatâ€™s your assessment of the current situation?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : The entire situation is in Khaplangâ€™s favour. As a result of the twin crossborder strikes Indian government seems to have played into the hands of Khaplang. Now Khaplang has emerged even stronger. Myanmar government is very upset over Indiaâ€™s cross-border strikes. Now there is no chance of Myanmar government listening to Indiaâ€™s demand that militant camps be removed from formerâ€™s territory. Khaplang will emerge stronger from this episode.NET: Insurgency and Northeast have become synonymous over the years. Why is it so?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : No region in the world has given birth to so many insurgent outfits as the Northeast. Not even Africa, Latin America and nor Myanmar. The factors that give rise to insurgent groups or insurgency is very much existent in the Northeast. The government has failed to tackle them. For the government, the Northeast is not that important, still a colony for the Indian government. Resources have to be extracted; armed struggles have to be suppressed with an iron hand. The Indian government has not yet understood the reasons what have given rise to insurgency nor is there any sincere effort to tackle the situation head on. Secondly, the Army with extraordinary power will not put an end to the problem.NET: So, where is the solution?Rajeev Bhattacharyya : As you know, currently there more than 50 insurgent groups in the Northeast. All the insurgent groups can be divided into five categories. Many people donâ€™t know that only about nine groups are demanding independence from India. Majority of the groups are demanding autonomy. The third category of the groups could be those without any ideology like that of GNLA of Garo Hills, who will do anything for money. The fourth group is sympathisers of the CPI (Maoist). There are reports that Maoists have been coming from Central India and started working in some pockets of the Northeast. But there is no concrete evidence of the reports. But one cannot lose sight of the fact that Maoists adopt a very long term plan. They work on a long-term perspective. Itâ€™s difficult to say at the moment if Maoist movement will actually grow or will fizzle out. The fifth
 group has grown with the influence of Jehadi groups and the Islamist groups of the states. This has been evident in the recent bomb blast in West Bengal and some sympathisers have been apprehended in Assam and in West Bengal. And I have reasons to believe that this network is spreading so this could be the most dangerous trend in insurgency in the Northeast, especially in Assam, in the years to come. The government better be on the lookout and persuasive on the whole scenario.(Rajeev Bhattacharyya is a senior journalist in Guwahati and author of Rendezvous with Rebels: Journey to Meet Indiaâ€™s Most Wanted Men. In 2011-12, he had spent four months at a rebel base in Myanmar where he interviewed ULFA chief of staff Paresh Baruah and NSCN-K chairman S S Khaplang besides interacting with top functionaries from other outfits that are now part of the new alliance called United National Liberation Front of Western South East Asia)Assessing Assam:Started in 1979, insurgency in Assam was at its height in the late 1980s. While the aim of the extremists has been independent Assam, the insurgency has roots in the history of Assamese sub-nationalism. The initial phase of militancy followed the changing fortunes of the Assamâ€™s agitation movement. In the writings of the Assamese author Parag Kumar Das, one finds the traditional economic grievances coming together with the theme of Assamese nationalism. Similarly, significant political movement for a separate Bodoland in Assam began in the year 1987. The campaign was launched by the All Bodo Studentsâ€™ Union (ABSU) under the leadership of Upen Bramha, who coined the term â€œDivide Assam Fifty Fiftyâ€.â€œThe perception of insurgency in Assam has been different in various generations. At this moment with a visible reduction in number of incidents and also factionalism, insurgency is more of an ideological threat than a physical one, it being nearly cleaned out by the army, government or globalization,â€ says Nayanjyoti Medhi, a Guwahati-based engineer, adding, â€œThis though is recent past, but the ghost that looms still prevents free flowing investments and scope for entrepreneurship, not because of fear but rather apprehensions. The world view of insurgency in Assam has to be changed for it to be rectified. Meanwhile, the present generation awaits for a revolution of peace.â€United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)ULFA was founded on April 7, 1979 at Rang Ghar, a symbolically significant venue of the Ahom kings, in Sivasagar district of Assam by some youths including Bhimakanta Buragohain, Arabinda Rajkhowa, Anup Chetia, Pradip Gogoi, Bhadreshwar Gohain and Paresh Baruah. The goal of the organisation is to restore Assamâ€™s â€œlost independenceâ€. Soon after it finished recruitment in 1984, it began to seek out training and arms procurement from other groups such as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). For one-and-a half decade, they almost run a parallel government in the state. However, on February 5, 2011, ULFA vice-chairman Pradip Gogoi along with foreign secretary Sashadhar Choudhury and central publicity secretary Mithinga Daimary announced that the outfitâ€™s general council had endorsed the resolution of the central executive council to sit for talks with the Central government without any precondition. But the commander-in chief Paresh Baruah-led group described â€œunconstitutionalâ€ the general council decision, thus negating the resolution. The formal split however took place in August 2012 when Paresh Baruah expelled Arabinda Rajkhowa and appointed Abhijit Barman as the outfitâ€™s chairman. The anti-talk faction of ULFA named them as ULFA (I) since April 5, 2013. They have around 300 active cadres, including those with the Myanmar camp. Of late, ULFA is facing financial crisis and it mainly dependent on NCSN (K) in Myanmar. Jibon Morang, whoâ€™s based in Taga region, has been shouldering the responsibility of financial revival. Currently, ULFAâ€™s eastern command is headed by Michel Deka Phukan and Dristi Rajkhowa is in the charge of its westerner command. And recently, Rajkhowa has built up a strong link with the Garo outfit GNLA.National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB)On November 25, 1994, the Rajan Daimari-led Bodo Security Force (BSF) rechristened itself as the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB). The main objective of the outfit is to liberate Bodoland from the â€œIndian expansionism and occupationâ€. During the 1990s, NDFB established 12 camps on the Bhutan-Assam border. After suffering major reverses during Royal
 Bhutan Armyâ€™s Operation All Clear, NDFB signed a ceasefire with the Indian authorities in May 2005.This was followed by a split into NDFB (P) â€“ the faction supported peace negotiations with the government â€“ and NDFB (R), which opposed surrender. In 2012, NDFB(R) split further, leading to the formation of NDFB(S) led by a non- Bodo, IK Songbijit. Prior to the military operations in Bhutan in December 2003, the strength of the NDFB was estimated to be around 3,500. Over the years the strength of the organization has substantially been reduced. Now it has around 500 cadres. Currently, with B Sargo Guera as president, Ferenga as secretary, Bidai and Batha as vice-presidents, the NDFB (S) has been recruiting new cadres to revive the outfit.Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO)Kuki Liberation Organisation was created by ULFA and it came into existence on December 28, 1995. The objective of the KLO is to carve out a separate Kamtapur state comprising six districts â€“â€“ Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, North and South Dinajpur and Malda â€“â€“ of West Bengal and four contiguous districts of Assam â€“â€“ Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon, Dhubri and
 Goalpara.Many secret operations along the Indo-Bhutan border have reduced the strength of the organisation. But still, KLO has over 100 active cadres. Although Jibon Singha of West Bengal is its chairman, currently the military wing has been taken care of by Kailash Koch. Recently, KLO, ULFA and the NDFB have formed an umbrella organisation to coordinate their activities.Nagaland and ManipurIn contemporary times, Nagaland and Manipur have been regarded as the breeding grounds for militants. Manipur alone has over 30 insurgent groups, a rare case for a small state. Manipur became a part of Indian on October 15, 1949. Its incorporation into the Indian state soon led to the formation of a number of insurgent organisations. Similarly, the demand for greater â€˜Nagalimâ€™ gave rise to a number of militant outfits in Nagaland. â€œJoining some militant organizations has become a fashion in our state and a wa of earning easy money,â€ says a student from Dimapur on condition of anonymity.National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN)
 The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) was formed on January 31, 1980 by Isak Chisi Swu, Thuingaleng Muivah and SS Khaplang opposing the â€˜Shillong Accordâ€™ signed by the then NNC (Naga National Council) with the Indian government.
 Later, differences surfaced within the outfit over the issue of commencing a dialogue process with the Indian Government and on April 30, 1988, the NSCN split into two factions, namely the NSCN-K led by SS Khaplang, and the NSCN-IM, led by Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah.NSCN (IM)
 Both general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah and chairman Isak Chisi Swu of NSCN-IM are now based in Thailand. The outfit has also established a government-in-exile called the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Nagaland (GPRN) which interacts with formal and non-formal world bodies. It has an estimated 3,500 strong cadre base. It is supported by a section of Aos, Semas, Zeilangs, Anals, Maos and Manipur-based Tangkhul Nagas. The group is in ceasefire with Indian Government since 1997.NSCN (K)
 Khaplang, popularly known as Baba, is perhaps the most respected militant leader of the Northeast. NSCN-K has cadre strength of approximately 3,500 with a following among the Konyaks of both India and Myanmar, the Pangmeis of Myanmar, the Aos of Mokokchung district, the Phoms and Yimchungers of Tuensang district, the Angamis, the Semas and the Lothas. The NSCN-K too runs a government-in-exile called the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Nagaland, NSCN-K.United National Liberation Front (UNLF): This group is the oldest militant group of Manipur and Rajkumar Meghen alias Sana Yaima is its current chairman. He was arrested in Bangladesh in 2010. Undeterred, the Manipur Peopleâ€™s Army, the armed wing of the UNLF, recently celebrated its 28th anniversary with pride. And Kh Pambei has emerged as a new popular leader. The outfit operates in the Jiribam valley and Cachar district of Assam.Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA):It was established under the leadership of N Bisheswar Singh on September 25, 1978. The PLA aims to organise a revolutionary front covering the entire Northeast and unite all ethnic groups to liberate Manipur. Revolutionary Peopleâ€™s Front (RPF) is its armed wing and Irengbam Chaoren is the president of the RPF. The group has a sound base in Manipurâ€™s Senapati district and almost 200 cadres undergoing guerilla training under Robin Lowang.Kuki National Front (KNF):Formed in 1988, KNF has a goal of sovereignty or independence from India. The group was formed in order to stand against NSCNâ€“IM hegemony in the Kuki-inhabited hill districts of Manipur. The group split into two factions in 1995 -presidential faction and military council, the former again splitting into two groups further.Meghalaya:Insurgency in Meghalaya is currently confined to Garo Hills region, although the hotbed was Khasi Hills till two decades ago. Militancy in Khasi Hills mostly triggered by the Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) was almost wiped out by iron hands.The outfitâ€™s existence is now just limited to calling occasional bandhs and issuing press statements whenever there is an issue confronting the Khasi community. On the other hand, Garo Hills, which comprises half of the stateâ€™s population, has become one of the most volatile regions of the Northeast. There are around a dozen â€˜militantâ€™ outfits that are born at the drop of a hat. There have been numerous cases of kidnappings, murder, and missing cases besides ambushes on security team claiming many lives in the past few years. The truce agreements and mass surrenders by some of the outfits have not been able to bring the desired results so far.There are also serious allegations of politico-militant nexus not sparing even the chief minister Mukul Sangma. One of his cabinet colleagues, Deborah Ch Marak, was even charge-sheeted by police for using militants during her election campaign in 2013. As the smoke appears to be not without a fire, cleansing of bad elements in politics will only bring about a solution to the insurgency in Garo Hills.Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA):Formed in 2009, the GNLA has been involved in killing, abduction, extortion, bomb blasts and attacks on security forces. It is fighting for a sovereign Garoland in the western areas of Meghalaya. The outfit was formed by a former deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Meghalaya, Pakchara R Sangma alias Champion R Sangma, after deserting the police force. He is the chairman of the outfit and Sohan D Shira, former Achik National Volunteers Council (ANVC) area commander for East Garo Hills, is the commander-in-chief of the outfit. The cadre base of the outfit is mainly formed by deserters from ANVC, Liberation of Achik Elite Force (LAEF) and National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB).Interview: Kiren Rijiju, Minister of State for Home AffairsNET: What is the root cause of Northeast region suffering from insurgency continuously?Kiren Rijiju: Itâ€™s a long history. Some of the insurgencies go beyond our initial days of Independence movement and there are historical reasons. The hill belt comprising northern Myanmar regions â€“ Kachin, Sagaing and Chin province â€“ and the contiguous Indian states â€“ Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram â€“ has been problematic for a long time. They were not initially satisfied with the
 boundary demarcations and all these things. So when we came to power, we have this legacy before us. There are various reasons â€“ ethnic issues, sub-nationalist movements, struggles for identity, struggles for autonomy, and struggles for separate identity â€“ breeding insurgencies. But the reality is these movements are not going to succeed because they canâ€™t get independence. The fact is that we are part of this country and we are citizens of this country and whatever we want, we have to fight within the framework  of the Constitution of India. If we go beyond that, then it spoils the whole atmosphere and it brings miseries to the common people. Suppose if I take up arms, I may dent the interest of the government of India but the greatest trouble I bring
 is to the people of the area, my own people. Because of my acts, my people have to suffer. We have to realise that we should not strive for something which is not achievable. If you want to get some political rights, then fight politically. Today, Iâ€™m fighting for Northeast. Iâ€™m fighting for the rights of my people but I am doing it in a democratic way. Taking up arms is no solution to any problem. So, this is something we must avoid.NET: If the solution lies in the development of the region?Kiren Rijiju: The solution is peace. If there is peace, there will be development. If there is violence, then there will be no development.NET: How has your government planned to bring in peace in the insurgency-ravaged region?Kiren Rijiju: To achieve that we are committed to securing peace and we are already doing the developmental projects.NET: Will your government at the Centre sideline Manipur government after the recent ambush in the state?Kiren Rijiju: No, nobody will be sidelined. I have made my view very clear that when we take up some security measures in the
 Northeastern region or anywhere else, the state government will be taken into confidence and all the security measures are always taken jointly by the Central security forces and the state police. Without the involvement of state government, you can have limited success but you cannot have complete success. And law and order is a state subject, so the state has to own the responsibility of securing peace. So thereâ€™s no question of bypassing the state government except if there are some specific operations.NET: Do you have any specific policy to curb insurgency in the Northeast?Kiren Rijiju: We are going to be very strict and those who are not coming to the line, security forces will be very tough with them but at the same time, from my side, Iâ€™d like to appeal to all the people who have taken up the arms route to come back, join the mainstream, and then we all will fight together for development. Let us fight for development. We must join hands together.
 So the doors are open for those who want to shun violence and those who continue to fight against the state, they will face problems because the government is very determined to secure peace, and while securing peace. Strong action is always necessary. Itâ€™s necessary to do away with all the bad elements. That is why I want to avoid this kind of unwanted, undesirable military operations and where local citizens face problems. So best is that there should not be any violence and all the civil societies of the Northeast must appeal to the underground groups to not take up arms and create problem for the local people.Rajarshi Kalita Asst Prof, Department of English
 Shyamlal College, Delhi University:Rather than asking why insurgency has not tapered out, we need to ask if the reasons that created insurgency have been addressed at the first place. Has the much reviled administrative system, notorious for its babudom, corruption and tardiness been tidied up? Have there been efforts to set up industrialization and development of farmers? What does the youth in Northeast, the ones who have not moved out of their states, have to fall back upon, other than in the cities and the bigger towns?Insurgency is not just a mode of protest for many deserving, frustrated young men and women. It has also turned into a sort of survival tactic, albeit fraught with jeopardy. Easy money, at the show of a weapon, lures the youth already bombarded with cultural images of successful people. The culture of hard work, entrepreneurship, inculcating the value of hard-earned money and setting up an environment for these qualities ought to do wonders. The administration also ought to be sensitive to the peopleâ€™s needs and try to erase draconian laws and acts which have done nothing to solve the intrinsically political problems of the region.In Retrospect:The issue of insurgency refuses to die down in the Northeast and it keeps on surfacing in different formats. Whatever had happened on June 4 in Manipur is highly condemnable as nothing can justify killings. But, there are very strange things happening along the Myanmar border in the name of avenge killings and even the Manipur government is clueless about the â€˜combing operations.â€™ There is no clarity on the twin strikes as claimed by the Central government and it has boomeranged India. Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyawardhan Singh Rathore comments that the â€˜cross borderâ€™ operation was a warning to others harbouring â€˜terrorist intentionsâ€™ towards India and reminding Pakistan that â€˜56 inch rocksâ€™ also have turned into poor diplomatic approach in international relations.All this chest-thumping and back-slapping resulted in Myanmar retorting angrily that Indian troops did not enter Myanmar territory and that Myanmar would not harbour any terror camps on its soil. Ajit Doval, the national security adviser, who immediately visited Myanmar for damage control, was not wellreceived. To curb insurgency in the Northeast region, all that it needs is a sincere effort. Creation of employment avenues and effective policies for the youths of the region can be a readymade answer. Instead of applying an iron hand, the problem should be addressed in a holistic manner."

China has allowed a second and shorter route to Mansarovar through Sikkim recently.Bagdogra is the only airport for Sikkim and North Bengal, and serves as the most important airport for a large area including Bhutan, Lower Assam, Eastern Bihar and Eastern Nepal, Rai said. It has vast economic and cultural importance for the people of Sikkim and North East, he added. Rai highlighted that the airport has witnessed considerable growth in air traffic, which crossed one million for the first time in 2014-15, growing at over 40% percent compared to last year.He also mentioned that any issues related to the expansion of the airport can be resolved through dialogue with the state government of West Bengal. Recently, there were reports that Airports Authority of India (AAI) was mulling shifting the crucial Bagdogra Airport due to delays in the airportâ€™s expansion plans.Sources claim the AAI voted to move the cityâ€™s gateway airport to Purnea in Bihar, owing to the installation of the proposed Instrumental Landing System (ILS). For  ILS, 12.91 acres of land  is required in the airport premises, followed by expansion of the airport terminal which needs another 120 acres.Earlier, the AAI held a meeting with Indian Air Force officials in Delhi to discuss the land acquisition process for the installation of night landing facility at the airport, extension of the terminal and setting up of residential quarters, following which the idea to relocate the airport to Purnea was construed, sources said.-TST"

The State Government has now committed to shift the household by 15th August and help AAI commence the work.The work is to commence from 1st October, 2015 (post monsoon season) and the facility shall be operationalized by September 2017. At present 75% of the development work has already been accomplished and the balance 25% work is to be completed in the next two working seasons The cost of Airport originally to be developed at the cost of Rs. 309.46 crores by AAI as Greenfield Airport has reason to Rs. 605.59 crores. Once this airport is developed, it will be capable of handling ATR-72 type of aircraft.Pakyong is the only airport in the State of Sikkim which otherwise has poor connectivity being, a hilly terrain prone to landslides during monsoon season causing difficulty in commuting to other parts of the country. Availability of airport will fulfil long awaited aspirations of the public at large and provide them excellent connectivity to various parts of the country and beyond thereby boosting the economy of the State. The land for the airport is being reclaimed by hill-cutting on the mountain side and using the excavated materials for geo-technical fill on the valley side.To retain the land fill on the valley side, retaining structure of 74 m (230 ft) height (reinforced soil wall/gabions containing excavated rock) has been constructed (Amongst the tallest reinforced structures in the world) The airport construction including navigational aids and passenger terminal will be completed by June 2017 and will be operationalized for commencement of flights by September 2017."

An official of Border Road Organisation (BRO), which maintains roads in the hilly terrain of Sikkim and Darjeeling district of West Bengal, said the rain-triggered landslides at Swati Jhora spot near the hill village blocked the arterial NH 10 on June 25.BRO personnel managed to open one side of the road for passage of small cars yesterday morning but boulders fell on that stretch soon after totally blocking the road again, the BRO official said. The calamities caused a major traffic snarl-up as passenger and tourist vehicles lined up on both ends.The vehicular traffic movement to Darjeeling town, however, remained unaffected as the Siliguri-Darjeeling route falls through a different stretch. Kalimpong, being on the same route to Sikkim upto certain distance, was also cut off from the plains."

The road there is not bad,â€ said Le Yucheng, Chinaâ€™s ambassador to India, during a conversation with a section of the China-based Indian media.The ambassador pointed out that Sikkim is looking forward to welcome Chinese tourists, businesses and investments. â€œSikkim is the closest state to China. Why not (develop) tourism? Why not trade? Why not investment? Why not environment protection because chief minister of Sikkim is known as the â€˜greenâ€™ chief minister. We also now have the strategy on environment protection,â€ observed the ambassador.Analysts however point out that the pulls and pressures of hard economics and security concerns are likely to determine the expansion of connectivity between the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China and Sikkim. Chinese concerns about the relatively unrestricted flow of Tibetans into India, and New Delhiâ€™s security unease about the Chumbi valley, are likely to emerge as focal points of a Sino-Indian dialogue. The Chumbi valley is the gateway of two major passes â€” Jelep La and Nathu La. It also juts out as an inverted triangle, on the tri-junction of Bhutan, China and India, terminating in close proximity of the Siliguri corridorâ€”the narrow passage that connects the North-East with the rest of India.â€œThey (the Sikkim government) are expecting Chinese tourists, expecting Chinese businesses, expecting Chinese investments. I think all these issues will be discussed in the years to come at the local l and the central level,â€ Mr. Le observed. In his conversation with the media at Yadongâ€”the town that was used in 1904 by the British expeditionary force to Tibetâ€” the ambassador said that border trade through Nathu La was now booming. â€œHe (Mr.Chamling) told me that this year especially, the Chinese trade mart is very busy. From our side also from the discussions I had with the local government, I have been told that the trade mart is booming.Many people are appealing to increase the items of trade; right not there are only 15 items, we need to double that.â€ Sherethang on the Indian side, and Renchen Qiang on the Chinese soil, are the two border trade marts, which conducted business worth around Rs.17 crores last year. While the Indian side of the road from Nathu La to Sikkim may need attention, connectivity to the border is well established by the highway that links Lhasa to Yadong. It takes less than eight hours to cover the around 500 kilometer distance, which passes through stunning landscape of the high, but mostly flat Tibetan plateau, before Yadong is approached.The Kamba La pass, at a dizzying height of 16000 feet connects Lhasa with the TARâ€™s Shannan prefecture. This district is known for its turquoise blue Yam Dro Yum Tso lake, an emblematic point of reference in the Buddhist religious calendar. Further ahead lies the TAR-Bhutan junction, before the road descends steeply towards Yadong, on the base of the Nathu la pass, forming Tibetâ€™s link with India.The ambassador did not rule out that in future, the Tibet-Nathula route to Sikkim could be connected to the much more ambitious Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) economic corridor. He praised Indiaâ€™s recent enthusiasm for establishing cross-border connectivity, under the framework of New Delhiâ€™s â€œAct Eastâ€ policy. Mr. Le pointed out that Chinaâ€™s Eurasian â€œBelt and Roadâ€ connectivity initiative could be harmonised with Indiaâ€™s â€œAct Eastâ€ policy.-The Hindu"
"149","http://www.northeasttoday.in/sikkim-hc-stricture-on-nagaland-lotteries/","Sikkim HC Stricture on Nagaland Lotteries","June 26 17:30 2015"," June 26 17:30 2015 &#59158; Print This Article &#59196; Share it With Friends &#128100; by Northeast Today  &#59160;  0 Comments In a significant development that would has a bearing on Nagaland State Lotteries, the Sikkim High Court has set aside appointment of the organiser of Sikkim State Lotteries and pulled up the state government for violating the provision of Section 3 (2) of Lotteries (Regulation) Rules 2010 putting lottery controversial lottery organiser M/s Future Gaming and other companies in the dock.Disposing a petition filed by one J. Geetha, proprietor M/s Sri Krishna Agency, Sikkim High Court Chief Justice Sunil Kumar Sinha in his order ruled that non-compliance of the Rules had vitiated the entire proceedings of the lottery undertaken by the Government of Sikkim for which the Court set aside all proceedings of the lottery, including the appointment of distributor M/s Future Gaming and Hotel Services Pvt.Ltd( run by Santiago Martin as MD) with immediate effect.The Chief Justice also noted that all four lottery companies were related through same shareholders. The order ordered that the Sikkim government bring out a notification under Section 3(2) of the Act before a single draw of the lottery. Interestingly, it was noted, that the state government had published the notification after three draws had taken place on March 9, 10 and 11, 2015 and next draws were fixed from March 12 to 15.In its judgment, the Court ruled that it was not a case in which the government had issued the notification in advance but the notification was issued only later i.e. after few draws were already over. Therefore, there was no proper compliance of the Rule 3 (3) of the Act, the court added. The case involved the manner in which the Sikkim government had allegedly favoured M/s Future Gaming and Hotel Services Pvt.Ltd and three other companies which the court found,were related by the same shareholders.M/s Future Gaming and Hotel Services Pvt.Ltd offered its bid and was appointed as lottery organiser for five years from 2004-09. At the expiry, no fresh tender was called and the same company given extension from 2009-14. Again on October 18,2014 the Sikkim lottery department issued extension from 2014-19 . The decision was challenged by M/s Sri Krishna Agency seeking the quashing of Rule 4(3) (a)(i) and (iii) of Sikkim State Lottery Rules 2003 and also the tender notice on November 14,2014 on the plea that the above rules were incorporated as the essential qualification for the tenderers to participate in the process.The same modus operandi appear to be followed with regard to Nagaland lottery with the same company M/s Future Gaming and Hotel Services Pvt.Ltd being shown undue favour. Award of contract for organising Nagaland State lottery draws has taken the legal route that led to suspension of draws from September 1 to 30,2009 thereby resulting in huge revenue loss estimated at Rs.13 crore to the state.The genesis of the current impasse started in 2003 when the state government, after opening bids appointed M/s Future Gaming &#038; Hotel Services Private Ltd (also formerly known as M/s Martin Lottery Agencies and M/s Future Gaming Solutions India Pvt.Ltd) as distributors for paper lotteries on March 11,2004 for a period of five years.The agreement was then extended for another period of five years from March 11,2009 to September 31, 2012 â€œwithout calling for fresh tenderâ€. The Nagaland government on June 27,2012 appointed M/sGaming India Distributors Ltd.with M/s Future Gaming &#038; Hotel Services Pvt.Ltd, wherein both were to pay Rs.35,000 for normal lottery and Rs.75,000 for bumper lottery.However Future Gaming &#038; Hotel Services Pvt.Ltd went to court and while the matter was being adjudicated, the government appointed the company on ad-hoc basis for six months for 24 lottery draws @Rs.15,000 per draw whereas as the bid amount accepted was Rs.35,000 per draw. The Ad-hoc agreement resulted in huge losses to the state exchequer.It may also be recalled that Congress leader Tokheho Yepthomi during the July 2014 assembly session had revealed that the another lottery company owed the state Rs.77 crore through a controversial order and the case is still under litigation. The order of the Sikkim High Court in upholding Section 3(2) of Lotteries (Regulation)Rules 2010 also sends a strong message on the government of Nagaland over conduct of lotteries."

India and China signed on September 18 last year a bilateral agreement on the alternative Nathu La route for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to China last month, announced in Beijing that the Nathu La Pass would be operational in June. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Tuesday flagged off the first batch of 50 members from New Delhi which reached here a day later. Ten pilgrims from the batch will not take part in the onward journey due to illness.A commemorative special postal cover was also released to mark the occasion. Chamling in his speech credited the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for the opening of the new route for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. The new route through the Himalayan pass of Nathu La 4,000 metres above sea level will facilitate more comfortable travel for the Indian pilgrims, especially for the elderly, by buses compared to the existing route via Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand.Opening of this route is also an important milestone in diplomatic relations between India and China. In all, 250 yatris would travel via the Nathu La route, in batches of 50 each. Eighteen batches of 60 people each would take the old route through Lipulekh Pass. Kailash Mansarovar is believed to be the seat of Hindu god Shiva. Pilgrims travel at high altitudes of 19,500 feet.
